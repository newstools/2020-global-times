The University of Glasgow has 172 confirmed cases, with 600 students self-isolating, said the Sky News.Many universities had promised students a mix of in-person and online teaching, raising questions about whether they should get a refund if teaching is only online or if they should be paying for university accommodation if all their lessons are delivered remotely.The Labour shadow education secretary, Kate Green, told the BBC that the option of student fee rebates should be kept "absolutely on the table."
