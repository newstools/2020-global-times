Winter ice in the Bering Sea, in the northern Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Russia, is at its lowest levels for 5,500 years, according to a study released on Wednesday. Researchers analyzed vegetation that accumulated on the uninhabited island of St Matthew over the last five millennia.They looked at variations in peat layers of oxygen atoms called isotopes 16 and 18, whose proportions over time correlate with atmospheric and oceanic changes and precipitation.

But the Bering Sea in recent decades has seemed stable, the authors of the study say - with the exception of 2018 and 2019, when a strong reduction was observed.The advantage of the new analysis, published in the journal Science Advances, is that it goes back much further in time, allowing researchers to establish whether the current levels are an anomaly or a trend.At this rate, conditions are now favorable for a completely "ice-free" Bering Sea, the authors conclude, setting in motion a domino effect of consequences on the ecosystem. "There's a lot more going on than simply warming temperatures," Jones said. "We're seeing a shift in circulation patterns both in the ocean and the atmosphere."Newspaper headline: More going on than warming
