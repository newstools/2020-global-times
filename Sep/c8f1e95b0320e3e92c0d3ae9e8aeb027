(Xinhua/Li Xin)Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region had constructed asphalt roads in all its counties by August, the regional transport department said.The region had also built hard roads in 86.4 percent of its townships and 61.4 percent of administrative villages. So far, it has rebuilt 38,200 km of rural highways, and 86,000 km of rural highways have been opened to traffic, according to the department.Tibet has a huge amount of land, harsh natural environment and poor transportation conditions due to historical reasons.
