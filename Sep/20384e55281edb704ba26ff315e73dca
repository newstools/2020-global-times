Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry Photo: VCGThe Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized the US for groundlessly accusing a Chinese company of assisting in the building of a military base in Cambodia.The US has repeatedly and groundlessly attacked the normal cooperation between China and other countries on the alleged grounds of national security, while it's the US that possesses hundreds of military bases in more than 150 countries around the world, said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Wednesday, slamming US hypocrisy and double standards.Some analysts said the US aims to contain China's strategic layout in Southeast Asia and destroy the cooperation between China and ASEAN countries, noting that the company is just involved in resort development, real estate investment and construction. Earlier this year, Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen directly denied that China was setting up a military base in the country.The US, out of the malicious intension to contain China, has constantly violated international law and basic norms, using all kinds of excuses to illegally impose sanctions on Chinese companies, said Wang. All countries should firmly denounce such tactics by the US in its efforts to preserve its hegemony, said Wang, noting that China will also take the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard companies' legitimate rights. Global Times
