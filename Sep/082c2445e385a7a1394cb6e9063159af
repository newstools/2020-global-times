The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 may have changed the original ecology of the classical music industry, but BMF stands ready to lead the industry in taking a big step forward in facing these new challenges," Yu said on Tuesday.  At a time when incorporating online events has become a must, the upcoming festival will not be an exception as it will launch its own BMF Club app, which will stream more than 240 hours of audio and video programs from renowned classical musicians and performers such as Warren Mok and Zhang Liping.  For the stage concert section, 20 performances including orchestral and chamber music concerts, solo recitals and more will be staged from October 10 to 20. A special section "Beijing and Wuhan" will unite musicians from these two cities to present the Chinese people's efforts in fighting against the deadly virus through a new classical work "Dedicated to 2020." Additionally, two themed series, Celebrating Beethoven's 250th Birthday and Born in 2000 will be also staged.
