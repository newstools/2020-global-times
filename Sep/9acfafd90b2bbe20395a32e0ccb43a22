It was the first known scheme of its kind and involved over 40 billion yuan ($5.73 billion) in digital currencies. Authorities have detailed 27 key suspects and a further 82 involved in the case. Violent crime has fallen partly because of the stay-at-home policy across China amid the COVID-19 epidemic, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) said in July.The news that China is one of the most secure countries in the world gathered wide recognition and applause across social media on Wednesday as many compared their travel experience with serious security worries overseas, especially in the US and some EU countries.Many large US cities released criminals from jail amid the COVID-19 pandemic, raising wide concerns that it may bring a spike in crime.Netizens suggested that it is hard to make the most populous country in the world the most secure as well.“But frequent traffic accidents, especially severe ones in recent months, remain a concern for the public,” said a Sina Weibo user. “There is still a long way to go in improving China’s legal system.”Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
