"This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever."The statement was also shared by Kardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, the family's highly adept "mom-ager." The post was signed by the three Kardashian sisters - Kourtney, Kim and Khloe - their mother, their brother Rob, their half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner and Scott Disick, the father of Kourtney's three children.The announcement comes after that of rap star West, who has four children with Kim Kardashian, that he is running for US president.West has also recently made enigmatic and disjointed, even incoherent, remarks on Twitter and at a campaign event, prompting his wife to open up about his bipolar disorder and ask for "compassion and empathy."Keeping Up with the Kardashians skyrocketed the entire family to fame, turning them into regulars in celebrity tabloids and helping them leverage their notoriety into multi-million dollar careers in makeup, perfume and modeling.
