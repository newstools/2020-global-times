A town government in East China's Shandong Province released guidelines on Monday to promote "thriftiness" and "good manners" when hosting weddings, such as suggesting the "caili" (engagement gifts) be worth no more than 10,000 yuan ($1,461.5).The guidelines include 11 items to help local residents be more economical and better-behaved during weddings. For example, it is recommended that no more than six wedding cars (not limousines) be used in a single wedding ceremony and each table should cost around 500 yuan (no less than 10 dishes) for the wedding banquet. In relation to the guidelines, some netizens agreed it should be promoted nationwide, but others suggested not everyone should be forced to obey them. "It would be another story if a groom is willing to give more engagement gifts to his bride."It also asks residents to avoid any "extreme pranks" during wedding celebrations, as such pranks have been often reported to the local authorities after turning violent or sexual.Playing pranks on brides and grooms on the wedding day has been traditionally regarded as a good way to "relax" the couple and family on their big day.However, the hashtag "playing pranks on wedding day" has triggered heated discussions on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo, with more than 250 million views. Chinese netizens criticized those who play violent pranks that cross the line into assault, often directed at brides, grooms, or their bridesmaids.In March 2019, the Ministry of Civil Affairs called for local authorities and communities in China to take action and combat lavish rural wedding traditions including expensive engagement gifts and uncivilized behaviors.
