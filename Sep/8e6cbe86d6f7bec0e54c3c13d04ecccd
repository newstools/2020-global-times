And China is about to launch a larger clinical trial of a vaccine for people over 55 years old.Chen noted that there are 182 COVID-19 vaccine candidates, of which 36 are in clinical trials and nine are in phase-III clinical trials, citing data from the World Health Organization (WHO). If even one country has the virus, the entire world's immunity cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, we still have a long way to go, and we will work hard to do it well, said Chen.On September 8, Chinese President Xi Jinping presented a national medal to Zhong and honorary titles to Chen and two other experts for their outstanding contribution in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic.
