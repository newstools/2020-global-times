The performance will be the troupe's first original show since the COVID-19 outbreak shut down theaters earlier in 2020. According to Feng Ying, the troupe's director, rehearsals and training for the performance had to be done through remote online meetings, which made preparing for the performance much more difficult. She said that this was a big challenge for the young dancers, who had to practice in their own homes, as well as the directors and choreographers, who needed to figure out how to best incorporate local Miao dance elements into Western ballet.
