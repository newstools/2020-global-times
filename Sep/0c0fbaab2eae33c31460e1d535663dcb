"We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests," Microsoft said."The Microsoft statement comes unexpectedly, and suggests that ByteDance has nearly reached a deal with other buyers or nailed down a plan that does not have Microsoft involved," said Liu Xingliang, director of the Beijing-based Data Center of China Internet.Microsoft might want to continue purchase talks with ByteDance by issuing such a statement in an unexpected way, Liu told the Global Times on Monday.ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment by the Global Times as of press time.China firmly supports ByteDance's legal rights and interests, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday, in response to the reported TikTok buyout.China has repeatedly stated its position on the TikTok issue - the hunt for TikTok in the US is a typical government coercion transaction, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, told a regular briefing on Monday.Apart from Microsoft, other TikTok bids came from Oracle, which Trump had endorsed, and Twitter. ByteDance's investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, have also been vying to be part of the TikTok deal.As clock ticks down for ByteDance to decide about TikTok's US business, Oracle Corp has won the bidding, which is set to be announced as TikTok's "trusted tech partner" in the US, and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.Trump said last week that the firm only has until Tuesday (September 15) to find a buyer. His August executive order set the date at September 20, if not extended. Meng Qingbin, a professor at the Business School of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday that a compromised deal - TikTok still keeps its core technology which is the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms while a US firm houses all the US users' data - will be the likely outcome."It will address the US government's concerns on data security though the Chinese firm has repeatedly said it has not done anything related to handing data to the Chinese government," said Meng.
