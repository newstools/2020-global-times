Canada's chief public health officer on Wednesday urged couples to wear masks during sex to prevent the spread of coronavirus."The lowest risk sexual activity during COVID-19 involves yourself alone," Theresa Tam said. But those having sex with a partner who is at risk or from outside their household should be "skipping kissing and avoiding face-to-face contact or closeness [and] consider using a mask that covers the nose and mouth."She noted that there is a "very low likelihood" of transmission of coronavirus through semen or vaginal fluids. But she still urged condom use.AFP
