Delta Air Lines also added one flight to its Seattle to Shanghai and its Detroit to Shanghai routes from August 24.According to a notice released on September 8 by the US agency, flights from China are only allowed entry to the US at seven airports, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta and Honolulu.Travelers from China to the US should undergo a 14-day quarantine at home or in a hotel, and they need to avoid social activities for 14 days, according to the note on September 8.Global Times
