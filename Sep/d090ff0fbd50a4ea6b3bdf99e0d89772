London's hard-hit live entertainment sector is hoping to prove it can resurrect itself from the coronavirus shutdown - and a series of gigs from a maze of tunnels could show the way to do it.Lockdown Town, which opens on October 2, will see socially distanced performances of US music from the 1920s to 1950s in a network of vaulted venues near Waterloo station.

Musicians perform a staged funeral for the "death" of live music, during a socially distanced photo call performance for One Night Records' forthcoming Lockdown Town production, on the banks of the River Thames in London on Wednesday.

But the gigs could be just the tonic the city needs."The public really want to see something at the moment... I've been craving to go dancing and listen to live music," she said."It's something that we have all been missing."During the shows, a costumed character with a cane will ensure health and safety regulations are strictly enforced.Penso predicted that would be the biggest challenge "but also that audiences are feeling safe enough to actually enjoy themselves."Newspaper headline: Vaulted venues
