"Their behavior shows they have flagrantly violated China's epidemic-preventing laws and regulations, and they severely threatened other passengers and crew members on the same flights."The embassy said it had informed the Chinese public security department about the incident. Those involved in the falsification of test results would be investigated for legal responsibility according to law, it added.
