Mobs had been hyping the rumor to incite riots in Hong Kong.Wang, however, surfaced on YouTube on Saturday, claiming he has been charged with eight criminal offenses by Hong Kong police for last year's riots, and faces several years in prison if convicted.Wang was due to appear in court on July 17, but skipped bail and fled to the UK.Wang was one of 600 people charged by Hong Kong police last year for participating in riots in the city, and among the first batch of people charged for the "8.31 riot." He was charged with two counts of rioting, two counts of criminal damage, one count of illegal assembly, one count of ordinary assault, one count of causing bodily harm, and one count of robbery.The UK has become the choice of hiding places for many Hong Kong secessionists, including Sunny Cheung and high-profile secessionist Nathan Law Kwun-chung. They are reportedly planning to use London as a base for opposition forces from Hong Kong.The little tricks expose mobs to ridicule as they always disregard the law and facts to achieve their goals. It is clear that those mobs try to defame the authority of the police officer and paralyze the social order by smearing the police and authorities, Tian Feilong, a Hong Kong affairs expert at Beihang University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday.Since the British government has suspended its extradition treaty with the HKSAR, those secessionists would be difficult for Hong Kong police to arrest. The legal loophole caused by the suspension of the extradition treaty is an indulgence for cross-border crimes, Tian noted."But no matter where they are, be they in Hong Kong or outside of it, the central government and SAR government have the right to punish them," Tian said.With Britain hosting more Hong Kong secessionists, Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming recently warned that harboring a so-called "parliament in exile" in the UK would pose new and severe obstacles to bilateral ties.On August 31 last year, rioters entered Prince Edward Station and changed their shirts in the train compartment of the MTR. After some residents argued with them, police went to the scene to enforce the law and sealed off the station.Newspaper headline: 14 arrested as hundreds illegally gather around Prince Edward station in Hong Kong
