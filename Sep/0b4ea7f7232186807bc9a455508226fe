The head of a primary school in London Tuesday prepares to provide a teaching environment safe from COVID-19 for pupils and teachers. Photo: AFPMillions of mask-wearing European children returned to school on Tuesday with governments determined to get pupils back in class despite still-rising coronavirus infections which surged over 4 million across the continent for the first time.Schools reopened in Russia, Ukraine, Belgium and France, where teachers and children aged 11 and older were obliged to wear face coverings, echoing regulations in place across the continent.Lockdowns imposed from March meant many children have missed months of education, as well as time with their friends."I've been waiting for this moment for a long time!" 12-year-old Chahda told AFP excitedly as she arrived with her friend at school in the southern French city of Marseille. However, the largest school district in the US - New York City - announced a delay to in-person classes at public institutions until September 21, after reaching a deal with a prominent teachers' union that had threatened a strike over health concerns it felt had gone unaddressed.In Europe, the decision to forge ahead with school reopenings comes as the virus is spreading rapidly again in many countries, raising fears that more lockdowns and disruption are to come in autumn and winter."I am convinced that we can and will prevent a second general shutdown," Germany's Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said, unveiling figures to suggest his country has passed the worst of its recession. An AFP tally of infections, using official data from across Europe, showed that more than 4 million people have contracted the illness, with Russia accounting for almost a quarter of infections. The virus has now infected more than 25 million people globally and killed almost 850,000. While schools attempt to get back to normal, the virus continues to play havoc with cultural and sporting events.The US is hosting the world's first major tennis tournament since COVID-19 emerged, but it has not been plain sailing at the US Open, where one player was sent home after testing positive and other players are grappling with eerie empty arenas.AFP
