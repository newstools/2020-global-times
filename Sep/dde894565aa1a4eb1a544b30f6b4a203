Wildfires are burning out of control in the western United States, cities are choking on toxic air, and Hurricane Laura battered the Gulf Coast on August 27.So why isn't the threat of global warming dominating the election contest between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden?

We're going to lose because we don't have a broad enough voting base," he said.Newspaper headline: Warming polls
