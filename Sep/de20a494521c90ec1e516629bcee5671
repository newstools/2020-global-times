We hope to do our best on this issue first."He dwelled little on political ideology or foreign policy goals, instead pledging administrative reform, an end to "bureaucratic silos," and greater digitalization of government.He said he would seek continued strong ties with Washington and stable relations with China and Russia.But he offered no details of ongoing tensions with South Korea, or any specifics of his defense strategy.The 71-year-old takes Japan's top job after decades in the political arena, most recently in the role of chief cabinet secretary, where he was a key enforcer of government policy as well as spokesman.A long-time Abe adviser and right-hand man, Suga has said his run was inspired by a desire to continue his predecessor's policies.His new cabinet is full of familiar faces, with Abe's foreign and finance ministers staying on, and the outgoing prime minister's brother appointed to lead the defense ministry.Suga won an easy victory in a vote in parliament, where his ruling Liberal Democratic Party holds a commanding majority.But he now faces a raft of tough challenges, from immediate problems like coronavirus and the postponed Olympics, to longer-term issues including a declining population.AFP
