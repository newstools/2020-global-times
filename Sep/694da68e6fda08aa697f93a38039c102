Collectors can download a digital app from China Post to any digital device with NFC functionality. By placing their device close to the number "40" that is on the stamp's face, the app will authenticate the stamp and provide information such as its serial number. NFC technology allows for contactless exchange of data over close distances. Invented during the early 21st century, it has been commonly used around the world in areas such as the mobile payment and anti-counterfeit measure fields. China has set a precedent with its ingenious incorporation of NFC technology in the design of a traditional postage stamp. It is the world's first postage stamp with a read-write chip.
