In this sector, Taiwan is complementary to the US, while posing no threat to the US' technological hegemony," Ma said.He said that TSMC's plan to build a microchips factory in the US under the Trump administration's pressure implies the US' purpose of getting the island's chip production under its firm control in a bid to ban Chinese mainland's access to advanced chips.With the semiconductor industry contributing about 15 percent of its GDP, Taiwan's dominance in this seemingly tiny but strategically important manufacturing makes it a natural target for the US amid its souring diplomatic ties with the mainland.While the island of Taiwan is dreaming of bright economic prospects by strengthening cooperation with the US, its reliance on the huge market of the mainland means there is a lot at stake for the island.Politicians in the island of Taiwan who continuously push for economic decoupling with the mainland for political gains, without considering the business community's interests, will find there are serious results, a Taiwan affairs expert who preferred to be anonymous told the Global Times on Tuesday.Recently, Huawei reached an agreement with Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer MediaTek to supply more than 120 million chips to diversify its supplies amid a tough US chip ban, according to media reports.The expert said that Chinese mainland imports $300 billion worth of microchips a year, of which about $60-70 billion come from Taiwan."The most advantageous industry for the island of Taiwan can become its biggest weakness," the expert said. "If the mainland shifts to chips made in South Korea or the mainland itself, the island's semiconductor industry would be paralyzed," the expert said, noting that history has proved that market demand is the most important factor for an industry's success."In early years when the island of Taiwan's industrial sector developed fast, many mainland businessmen rushed to the island to invest in the semiconductor sector to supply the mainland. Now faced with political headwinds, they may choose to directly invest in the mainland - in such locations as Shanghai and Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province," Ma said.Newspaper headline: US sees Taiwan a ‘safe’ chip factory
