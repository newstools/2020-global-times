For the first time in its 175-year history, US magazine Scientific American has endorsed a White House candidate, saying Tuesday it wanted Democrat Joe Biden to prevail because President Donald Trump "rejects" science.

But coronavirus is just the first in a lengthy list of Trump trip-ups and alarming policy positions, say the editors, including his "ongoing denial of reality" regarding climate change that has "hobbled" US preparations for battling the crisis. "He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges," they added."That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment."The former vice president "comes prepared" with a multitude of plans to control COVID-19, they write. His $2 trillion plan to create an emissions-free power sector by 2035 will help reduce carbon emissions, and he will restore the role of science in policymaking. "These and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future," the editors say. Founded in 1845, Scientific American reaches more than 10 million people worldwide.Newspaper headline: In first, Scientific American magazine endorses Biden for US president
