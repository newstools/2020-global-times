Despite this, China's absorption of foreign investment and outbound investment has maintained an overall balance," Gao said.A recent survey released by the US-China Business Council showed that 83 percent of the companies surveyed regard China as one of their most important markets in the world."This fully reflects the confidence of foreign investors in the Chinese market. China will unswervingly open wider to the outside world, improve the business environment and share China's development opportunities with investors from other countries," Gao added.
