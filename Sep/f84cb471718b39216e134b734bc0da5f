The hardest-hit will need support to make sure that what should be temporary reversals don't become permanent," said the report."Developing and manufacturing vaccines won't end the pandemic quickly unless we also deliver them equitably. Some governments that have made bets will win those bets, but if they use all the available vaccine to protect only their people, they will be extending the life of the pandemic everywhere. They will also be contributing to a much larger death toll," the report argued.According to modeling from Northeastern University, if rich countries buy up the first 2 billion doses of a coronavirus vaccine, instead of making sure they are distributed in proportion to the global population, then almost twice as many people could die from COVID-19, said the report that also called for more countries to join the COVAX Facility.IHME estimates that extreme poverty is up 7 percent in just a few months because of COVID-19, ending a 20-year streak of progress. Already in 2020, the pandemic has pushed almost 37 million people below the $1.90 a day extreme poverty line. The poverty line for lower-middle-income countries is $3.20 a day, and 68 million people have fallen below that line since last year.
