Others are poems by the likes of Lebanese legends Gibran Khalil Gibran and Said Aql that are set to music.She has largely disappeared from public life in recent years, but her soaring voice remains ubiquitous, blaring every morning from radios in street cafes and taxis."When you look at Lebanon now, you see that it bears no resemblance to the Lebanon I sing about, so when we miss it, we look for it through the songs," the diva told the New York Times.Fairuz also won national acclaim for remaining in Lebanon throughout the country's civil war from 1975 to 1990, and for refusing to side with one faction over another.Tens of thousands of people swarmed her first post-war concert, in 1994 in Beirut's downtown."I love you, oh Lebanon, my country, I love you. Your north, your south, your valley, I love you," she croons in one of her most well-known songs.Political, family controversiesFairuz is famously protective of her personal life."When she wants to, she can be really funny. She's also a distinguished chef. Very humble, she loves serving her guests herself," journalist Doha Chams, her press officer, told AFP.But she hates "the invasion of her private life."Fairuz had four children with husband Assi Rahbani, who died in 1986.Their daughter Layal died at a young age of a brain hemorrhage, their son Hali is disabled, and Rima, the youngest, films and produces her mother's concerts.Her eldest son, Ziad, followed in the footsteps of his father and uncle as a musician and composer.Fairuz worked closely with Ziad - known as a troubled, but talented artist - to compose songs with a jazz influence.The Lebanese star's recent past has been marked by a string of family and political controversies.In 2008, when Lebanese political factions were fiercely divided over support for the regime in neighboring Syria, Fairuz performed in Damascus.Two years later, the Lebanese judiciary prevented her from singing tunes co-written by the Rahbani brothers without the authorization of the sons of her brother-in-law Mansour.Fairuz spent several years without new material until 2017, when her daughter Rima produced her last album, Bibali.Newspaper headline: Immortal icon
