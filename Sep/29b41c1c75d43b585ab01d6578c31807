The move demonstrates an effort to further open up as the coronavirus pandemic continues and unilateralism rises globally. In particular, Beijing’s FTZ aims to build the city into a globally influential technology and innovation center, in tandem with the accelerated development of the services and digital economy sectors, according to a plan issued by the State Council on Monday. Covering an area of 119.68 square kilometers, the Beijing FTZ will focus on next-generation information technology, biology and technology services, and to build a pilot zone for the digital economy and a global investment center for start-ups. The Beijing FTZ, which for the first time prioritizes tech innovation, services and the digital economy, aims to set an example to the rest of the country to boost the services sector and narrow China’s trade deficit in this sector, experts said. For example the plan will support the central bank to set up a fintech center in the capital city, build pilot zones for legal digital currencies and digital finance systems with blockchain technology. The Hunan FTZ will focus on improving overseas investment and international cooperation, in particular with African countries and those along the Belt and Road Initiative.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta economic zone, Anhui’s FTZ, which contains a wealth of smart manufacturing enterprises, is set to boost the region’s development and high-end manufacturing, integrated circuit, artificial intelligence and cross-border ecommerce industries, according to the plan. In addition, Ningbo in East China's Zhejiang Province will be allowed to expand its pilot FTZ and will have an international shipping hub, influential oil and gas resource allocation center, supply chain innovation center and a high-quality smart manufacturing demonstration plot. As a significant foreign trade shipping hub, the Ningbo Zhoushan Port saw its import and export value from January to July hit 526.64 billion yuan ($75.61 billion), up 0.9 percent year-on-year amid the pandemic.
