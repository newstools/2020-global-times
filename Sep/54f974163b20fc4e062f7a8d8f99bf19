A collective failure by political leaders to heed warnings and prepare for an infectious disease pandemic has transformed "a world at risk" to a "world in disorder," according to a report on international epidemic preparedness.

Metro rail services in New Delhi Saturday morning resumed fully after remaining shut for over five months due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, officials said.

COVID-19 has proven the point."The report noted that despite calling a year ago for heads of government to commit and invest in pandemic preparedness, for health systems to be strengthened and for financial risk planning to take seriously the threat of a devastating pandemic, little progress had been made on any of these. A lack of leadership, it said, is exacerbating the current pandemic."Failure to learn the lessons of COVID-19 or to act on them with the necessary resources and commitment will mean that the next pandemic, which is sure to come, will be even more damaging," it said.Newspaper headline: GPMB report sounds warning
