At least 289 people were arrested in Yaumatei and Mongkok on Sunday, according to police. The liaison office condemned the stubborn members of "lam chau" who insist on inciting street confrontation, using the postponed Legislative Council (LegCo) elections as an excuse. The illegal act of violating the gathering restriction order during the COVID-19 epidemic is a violation of relevant laws and state will, and also shows cold-blooded disregard for the lives and health of the general public, the office said.During a time when the epidemic situation in Hong Kong is not optimistic, there are still some people who instigate trouble, spread all kinds of rumors, and constantly attack and discredit the aid from the mainland in Hong Kong's fight against the epidemic. They have no bottom line or conscience in their unlimited politicization and hype, which disregards public safety and interests, the office said. After the enactment of the national security law, Hong Kong society has experienced a positive change from chaos to stability, said the office, warning small groups of rioters that the authorities will have zero tolerance for anyone who attempts to shake the city's stability.Global Times
