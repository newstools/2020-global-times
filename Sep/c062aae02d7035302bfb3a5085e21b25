The pandemic-delayed Oscars are still seven months away, but Frances McDormand's Nomadland cemented its early frontrunner status by bagging the Toronto film festival's top prize on Sunday.

Chinese director Chloe Zhao and Fox Searchlight Co-Chairman Stephen Gilula attend the drive-in premiere of her film Nomadland on Friday in Pasadena, California.
