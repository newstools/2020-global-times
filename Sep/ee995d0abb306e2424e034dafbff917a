vaccine Photo:VCGChina will strengthen the deployment of flu vaccines nationwide and expand vaccination availability in preparation for the upcoming flu season as the country plans to carry out comprehensive prevention measures for both potential influenza and COVID-19 waves. The National Health Commission (NHC) of China on Tuesday published a plan on the national flu prevention and control work in the upcoming winter and spring months, which requires authorities at all levels to step up their precaution measures for influenza as COVID-19 still poses a threat. The plan requires health authorities to conduct a demanding assessment of influenza vaccines at local vaccination sites and strengthen the dynamic deployment of influenza vaccines based on the analysis of the procurement, supply and distribution of the vaccine in each location to ensure a balanced supply around the country. The number of flu vaccine doses in 2020 is expected to double from 2019 to 50 million, and some cities in China, such as Beijing, have already launched a full-scale influenza vaccination program for local residents. The NHC's plan also noted the cost of flu vaccinations for key populations, including medical personnel, children, the elderly and patients with chronic diseases, should be reduced so as to increase vaccination coverage among them.Facing potential "dual infections" of both the flu and COVID-19, the NHC has regulated that fever clinics should strengthen their pretesting processes for patients with similar symptoms of both diseases and strictly carry out separate and targeted diagnosis and treatment for patients of each kind.
