Photo:XinhuaAlmost half of the US states are reporting increasing numbers of new COVID-19 cases as health experts warn of a potential coronavirus surge in the United States in the fall and winter.As of Sunday, the number of new COVID-19 cases has increased by at least 10 percent or more compared to the week before in 21 states, most of them in the West, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.Cases are rising in 21 states such as Alabama, Alaska, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina and Wyoming.Eighteen states were holding steady. Only 11 states including Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee and New Hampshire saw decreases of new cases of more than 10 percent compared to the week prior.A latest projection of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington has forecast a major winter surge in the United States, leading to 3,000 deaths a day by the end of the year."Daily deaths are expected to reach 3,000 per day in late December. The reference scenario suggests that cumulative deaths will reach 371,000 by January 1," said the projection.The large increase in daily deaths expected in late November and December is driven by continued increases in mobility and declines in mask use, but most importantly by seasonality, according to the IHME.
