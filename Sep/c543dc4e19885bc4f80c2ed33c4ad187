A 33-year-old man living in Hong Kong was reported in August to have been infected for the second time this year. Media reports said that the man's second infection occurred 142 days after the first.Â Similar individual cases were reported around the world later, which also triggered public concerns over whether a recovered COVID-19 patient could be infected for a second time.
