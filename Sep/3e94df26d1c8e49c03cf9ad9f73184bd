For the third time this year, torrential rains have hit Yemen, making "an already catastrophic humanitarian situation even worse," a UN spokesman said on Thursday.In late July and August, flooding damaged infrastructure, destroyed homes and shelters, ruined crops and killed people and livestock in governorates across the country already suffering from civil war, the COVID-19 pandemic and growing risk of famine, said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Estimates indicated that more than 62,000 families were affected across the country.

Additionally, there are 3.65 million displaced people in the country.The latest OCHA figures on the COVID-19 pandemic show 1,962 confirmed cases, including 567 deaths and 1,133 recoveries as of the end of last month.The population of Yemen is about 20 million people.

Only 811.5 million U.S. dollars of the 3.38 billion U.S. dollars that are needed have been donated."We urge donors to pay all outstanding pledges immediately and we urge those who have yet to pledge or pay to do so and increase support," the spokesman told correspondents at a regular, virtual briefing.
