All employees at a Taiwan factory in Dongguan, South China's Guangdong Province, which produces furniture and mattress, have returned to work as China fully contained coronavirus epidemic.

However, after June, most orders started to come in, and most of those have been shipped," Hu said.Despite those increased orders, not every company has been so lucky.Botex Manufacturing, which makes gloves, hats, scarves and indoor slippers, gets 60 percent of its overseas orders from the US. An official told the Global Times that it has seen a nearly 25-percent order decline from the US market since January.But that's not because of any "decoupling" plan, Li Kitchi, general manager of Botex, told the Global Times on Tuesday."Due to the recession, our clients are not able to stockpile amid growing uncertainty, but their demand remains unchanged," Li said, adding that from his point of view, US demand for Chinese consumer goods won't end, given the high quality.China-US trade data seems also to deal a blow to Trump's plan. According to US research company Descartes Datamyne, the number of 20-foot equivalent containers shipped from China to the US rose 19 percent in August from a year earlier to nearly 1.07 million, accounting for 63.4 percent of all shipments from Asia to the US.China's irreplaceable industry chains are another reason that decoupling is likely to fail, these manufacturers said."It is considered extremely difficult to shift factories out of China as companies would have to face issues such as inadequate industry chains, high training costs, and cultural and language differences. Mostly, though, it's the inadequate industry chains," Chen said.According to Chen, there are only four major golf club producers worldwide, three in the Chinese mainland and one in the island of Taiwan."One of our peers tried to set up a factory in Mexico years ago. However, it moved back in the second year, as many issues including cultural differences, language barriers, and insufficient raw material supplies were hard to address," Chen said.According to Li, China's industry chains can't be replaced for 10 years, considering the easy access to raw materials and an efficient labor force, which can effectively lower the cost of goods."Even though some companies had to shift factories to some Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam or Indonesia, to avoid the US tariffs, most of them are still buying raw materials from China, or even leaving the final assembly to overseas factories," said Li."The basic rule of manufacturing is to use every legitimate means to lower costs, and apparently the 'decoupling' plan violates the rule," said Li, adding that the plan is more like a political slogan than a realistic practice.Newspaper headline: Decoupling plan ‘unrealistic’
