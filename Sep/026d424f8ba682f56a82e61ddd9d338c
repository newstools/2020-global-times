The main military and political officers at his company received executive warnings, and the squad leader was transferred from the post and received a disciplinary probation of three months.Soldiers and officers must have a strong sense of confidentiality, keep network security in mind and closely abide by related disciplinary regulations, the command said.Responsible for the Taiwan Straits, the PLA Eastern Theater Command has been one of the most exercise-intensive PLA commands this year. In addition to many regular and routine exercises, the command has been holding large-scale military drills in the Taiwan Straits, including a series of real combat-oriented exercises since Friday, which are targeting the current cross-Straits situation, according to Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, spokesperson at the Ministry of National Defense.Global Times
