We have seen the results when each country pursues its own strategy, with the advice of the World Health Organization being largely disregarded.""When countries go in different directions, the virus goes in every direction," he noted."Second, we still lack effective international solidarity to respond to the economic and social impacts and the underlying fragilities exposed by the pandemic."The secretary-general said that more than ever, effective international solidarity is key to advancing these priority areas and build a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable world for all.
