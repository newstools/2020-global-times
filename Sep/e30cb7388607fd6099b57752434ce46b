Pfizer and BioNTech are partnering on the third candidate.

FIFTY-NINE DAYS. Is any #COVID19 #vaccine likely to have completed Phase 3 safety and efficacy clinical trials, and gone through full scientific and @US_FDA review in 59 days?" award-winning epidemiology writer Laurie Garrett asked on Twitter."To my knowledge, none of the US #COVID19 #vaccines have finished even enrolling test subjects for Phase 3 trials. Rushing this to completion within 59 days is DANGEROUS."FDA chief Stephen Hahn, however, has denied he is acting under pressure from Trump, arguing that any vaccine approval would be a "science, medicine, data decision."The US has registered more than 6 million COVID-19 cases - almost a quarter of the global total - and 185,000 deaths.Shutdowns have taken a toll on livelihoods across the globe as business revenues plunge and millions are forced out of work.In Europe, where GDP plunged 12.1 percent in the three months to June, fears are growing of more lockdowns and disruption in the autumn and winter of 2020 as the virus resurges.The French economy has been pushed into its worst downward spiral since 1945, with GDP down 13.8 percent in the second quarter, after a drop of more than 5 percent in the first.Global economic decline Paris, hoping to ward off the threat of mass layoffs, has earmarked 100 billion euros ($120 billion) to counter the devastating impact of the coronavirus.Some critics say the money may come too late to save many companies, while others say high hopes for President Emmanuel Macron's green revolution in the French economy are likely to be dashed.Economists have welcomed the departure from the kind of austerity measures seen after the 2008 crisis which were "a huge error," said Philippe Martin, who heads up the CAE think tank, which advises the government.Unlike the post-2008 crisis response, much of the new plan targets the supply and investment side of the economy, namely businesses.The measures over the next two years include 10 billion euros' worth of corporate tax cuts.Youth employment is also a major target of the spending, with 6.5 billion euros aimed at encouraging hiring for millions of new entrants on a depressed job market.In Australia, the government announced a record contraction of 7 percent despite authorities providing billions of dollars in support to struggling firms.New Delhi reported that growth suffered a historic 23.9 percent decline in the second quarter, while Brazil's economy contracted by a record 9.7 percent.And to add insult to injury for the sports-mad South American nation, soccer icon Neymar was one of three Paris Saint-Germain stars to have contracted the coronavirus, a well-placed source told AFP."Three Paris Saint-Germain players have confirmed positive Sars CoV2 tests and are subject to the appropriate health protocol," PSG said in a statement.
