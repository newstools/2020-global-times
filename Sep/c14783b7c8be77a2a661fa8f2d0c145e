Photo: VCGA university in East China's Anhui Province on Tuesday recalled a controversial health education guidebook provided to its students as it defined homosexual behavior as "perverted" in addition to discriminating against homosexual people, media reported on Wednesday.Huaiyin Normal University told local media that "there is inappropriate content within the health guidebook concerning homosexuality and the relevant personnel will be organized to revise its content and delete inappropriate sections."Images were spread online revealing the book's content including suggestions that "homosexuality is against 'natural rules' and is a character defect … the life-span of homosexuals is shorter [compared to others] and they are more likely to be addicted to drugs," as well as "homosexuality is 'perverted' and can lead to social instability."Cui Le, a gender and education researcher, told thepaper.cn that the homophobic guidebook could lead to multiple negative impacts on the university campus including bias, discrimination and even bullying. "Chinese universities should be more inclusive, multi-polar and fair so as to prevent discrimination based on gender and identity," Cui said.Chinese netizens were seen to have been split over the case.Although some praised the university's quick response in addressing the controversial content, saying it shows clear social progress in China, others claimed the university was justified in making such claims about homosexual people.
