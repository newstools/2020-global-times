Xi also awarded national honorary titles to three other experts for their contribution to fighting COVID-19.To conclude the ceremony, Xi spoke for over an hour, during which he hailed China's hard-won victory over COVID-19 and recounted touching stories of numerous people who made great contributions to this battle, and also how China has helped other ravaged countries fight the virus. Xi said that China took about a month to initially curb the spread of the epidemic, took about two months to bring the number of daily new domestic cases to single digits, and about three months to beat COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei. China then fought several battles to annihilate clustered infections in cities, eventually achieving a major strategic result in the national fight against the epidemic.Through practical actions, China has helped save the lives of thousands of people around the world and demonstrated China's sincere desire to promote the building of a community with shared future for mankind amid the epidemic, he said."To protect the lives of people, we will do everything!" President Xi said.  From newborns to elderly people in their 100s, from foreign students in China to foreigners in China, every life deserves to be protected, every human life, value, and dignity should be cared for.Xi also said that China is the first major economy to resume growth after the heavy blow of COVID-19, and is leading the world in virus prevention and economic recovery, which shows China's great capacity for restoration and exuberant vitality.In the face of the sudden and severe COVID-19 epidemic, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) took charge of the overall situation, took decisive measures, and responded to the uncommon event with uncommon actions, said Xi.    The fight against the pandemic has once again proven that the extremely strong leadership of the CPC is the most reliable backbone of the Chinese people when storms strike, according to Xi.Globally, COVID-19 cases across the world have gone up to more than 26 million, with the most cases coming from the US, followed by India, according to Johns Hopkins University.Xi said that no country can be safe alone in this huge crisis; any selfish moves, any buck-passing, any deeds that confuse right and wrong will not only bring damage to its own people, but also spread harm to other parts of the world.Tuesday's commending of role models and heroes who fought in China's phased victory against the deadly coronavirus reflects the country's perseverance and will to win, even when faced with a complicated situation at home and a crackdown by hegemonic powers abroad, analysts said.  Xi said that we should be well prepared in the long term for a changing environment from the outside world. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
