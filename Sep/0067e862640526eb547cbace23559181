Taiwan Photo:VCGÂ Taiwan companies received export orders from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong worth of 12.88 billion US dollars in August, up 21 percent year on year and 7.5 percent over July, the island's economic affairs department said Monday. Orders for electronic products showed the greatest increase, growing by 43.7 percent year on year in August, followed by orders for basic metals and optical components, the department said in a press release. Export orders from the United States, Europe and the Association of South East Asian Nations also increased year on year in August, while those from Japan dropped, the statement said. Taiwan companies saw total export orders up 13.6 percent year on year to 45.49 billion dollars in August, but slightly down by 0.2 percent from that of July. The department attributed the increase of export orders to the soaring demand for high-end semiconductors and long-distance communication products. The statistics consist of export orders taken by Taiwan enterprises and produced both in and outside Taiwan.
