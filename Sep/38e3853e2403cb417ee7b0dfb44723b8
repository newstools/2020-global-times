He froze. He failed to act. He panicked. And America has paid the worst price of any nation in the world."Trump insisted on "Fox and Friends" Monday that the US was "rounding the corner with or without a vaccine."But the president has high hopes that the swift approval of a vaccine will boost his reelection chances."I would say that you'll have [a vaccine] long before the end of the year, maybe by the end of October," he told Fox. Trump has set even more ambitious goals, stating that by April of 2021, most Americans who want to be immunized will have a vaccine. Most experts argue that betting on vaccines is not a viable strategy.Without adhering to masks, distancing and contact-tracing, and without ramping up testing, tens of thousands more could still die before life returns to normal in the US."What we need to do is shift... toward a more screening approach that's proactive to test asymptomatic individuals," Harvard surgeon and health policy researcher Thomas Tsai told AFP.He said the government should approve rapid, at-home antigen tests, which it has been reluctant to do so far, and which would require the government to pay for it instead of insurance companies.AFP
