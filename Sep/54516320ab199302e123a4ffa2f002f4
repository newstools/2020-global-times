China is expected to record 550 million domestic tourists during the upcoming eight-day Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday season, said the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Sunday. China's state railway operator said on Monday that it expects to handle 108 million passenger trips during the 11-day travel peak of the National Day holidays, an average of 9.82 million trips per day. The railway operator said that Thursday, China's National Day, will see the peak of passenger flow, with an estimated amount of 13 million trips - setting a new high in the daily average passenger flow on the railways since the outbreak of COVID-19 began.Meanwhile, China's domestic flights are also expected to push past pre-COVID levels. Global travel data and analytics outfit Cirium said in a statement sent to the Global Times that more than 164,700 domestic flights were scheduled during the period, an increase of more than 11 percent, compared with the same time in 2019 when approximately 148,000 flights flew."I have been waiting for the holidays for months; the eight-day holidays are also perfect for my planned trip to Daocheng Yading, the famous scenic spot in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province," Chen Xiaoying, a white-collar worker who is employed by a real estate firm in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Monday, noting that almost all her friends have travel plans for the holidays since they've been "cooped up" for such a long time.According to the survey results that Rong360 Jianpu Technology sent to the Global Times, respondents who have planned to travel during the National Day holidays account for more than 60 percent of the total, increasing significantly over the first half; more than half of the respondents would like to scale up their budget for the National Day holidays, presenting good prospects for the tourism market.With the expected consumption explosion in almost "all sectors," experts said the booming tourism market is expected to further drive the economic recovery in the world's second-largest economy, and inject fresh momentum to the world's post-pandemic recovery while some others were still caught up in the rampant rise of  COVID-19 cases.

Still, China faces the challenging task of fending off imported infections as several countries including the UK and the US have been recording spikes in new cases in recent weeks with schools and businesses reopening. "As long as the country does not relax its restrictions on travel abroad, it's impossible that China will see a massive rebound in coronavirus cases in the coming months," Yang said. Frozen outbound tourismExperts cautioned that considering the grave COVID-19 pandemic situation overseas, suspended outbound tourism is still necessary as the total coronavirus cases worldwide have surpassed 32 million.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also reminded citizens on Monday that Chinese people traveling abroad should be cautious and shouldn't travel unless it's necessary during the upcoming eight-day Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays. "Outbound tourism is still unlikely to recover for at least one to two years, or as long as four years as some other industry players pointed out," Bao said, noting that mass-scale vaccination may be the only turning point for a full recovery of overseas travel. Xu noted that China's tourism recovery could also offer a path to their foreign counterparts. "A basic experience at its core is to first realize prevention and control of the epidemic, and restore social production and development order as much as possible.""However, one should realize the orderly opening of the tourism industry in a step-by-step manner instead of all at once. If you look at China's measures from the very beginning, we first keep tourist numbers below 30 percent of the reception capacity, then 50 percent, and now at about 80 percent," Xu said.
