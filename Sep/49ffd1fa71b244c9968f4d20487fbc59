The lack of survival experience on an extraterrestrial body adds to the difficulty, he said. A manned space lab deployed to the moon that is able to support multiple astronauts in their days-long lunar exploration activities is also part of the tentative roadmap.China has made four successful unmanned probe missions to the moon so far with zero failures, including the Chang'e-4 soft landing on the far side of the moon at the beginning of 2019, the first in human history. China plans to take another flight to the moon with the Chang'e-5 lunar probe, aiming to bring lunar samples back to Earth. This could be launched before the end of this year, Yu Dengyun, deputy chief architect of China's moon exploration program, said on Friday at the conference, which was held in Fuzhou, East China's Fujian Province.
