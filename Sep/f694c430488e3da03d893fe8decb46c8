The regulator also imposed a fine of 5 percent of the funds raised in the IPO, which amounts to 240 million yuan.In response to the question about Jia's ban from the securities market, Jia's debt handling team also issued a statement on Friday, saying that the punishment received by the CSRC is only an advanced notice, not the final result, according to media reports.No matter what the final punishment is, Jia will never evade responsibility and will take responsibility and no more than 10 percent of his creditor trust will be used to compensate leTV shareholders, the statement said, according to the report. Founded in 2007 by Jia Yueting, the billionaire chairman of Chinese technology group LeEco, LeTV was once seen as a potential Chinese technology titan, but was involved in lawsuits due to debt problems since 2017.After running up a huge debts, Jia fled to the US in 2017 to escape punishment in China.
