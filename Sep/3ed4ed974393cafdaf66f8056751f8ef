The shallow structure profile indicates that the material detected by Yutu-2 comes from the nearby Finsen impact crater, and not the basalt erupted from the lunar mantle, Xinhua said. These new discoveries are of great significance to the understanding of the evolution of the South Pole-Aitken basin of the moon, and are important for the subsequent exploration and study of the composition and structure of the lunar interior. The researchers used a near-infrared spectrometer, panoramic camera and lunar radar carried by Yutu-2 and other data, and have achieved a number of scientific results which have been recently published in international journals. Launched on December 8, 2018, the Chang’e-4 probe made the first-ever soft landing on the Von Karman Crater in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon on January 3, 2019.The Chang'e-4 lander and Yutu-2 rover completed their 22nd lunar day of work on Thursday, receiving ground instructions to set the lunar night mode settings for dormant mode. A lunar day is equal to 14 days on Earth, and a lunar night is the same length. The Chang'e-4 probe, switching to dormant mode during the lunar night due to the lack of solar power, has survived 630 Earth days on the moon as of Thursday, and the rover traveled 547.17 meters on the far side of the moon.  Global Times
