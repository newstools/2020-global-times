(Xinhua/Israel Civil Administration) Israeli archaeologists have discovered an entire inkwell dating to about 2,000 years ago, the Israeli Civil Administration in the West Bank (ICA) said Wednesday. The inkwell was found in an archaeological site near the Jewish settlements cluster of Gush Etzion. ICA's spokesman, Roee Salmon, told Xinhua that the inkwell was found under a floor of an ancient Roman building, dating to the Second Jewish Temple period. The inkwell was made of a flat-bottomed clay cylinder with a round handle and a narrow opening with an inward-sloping rim, through which the ink and pen were inserted. Salmon noted that the height of the inkwell is about six centimeters and the diameter about four centimeters at the top.

This discovery strengthens the hypothesis that literacy was relatively common among the Jewish population in ancient Israel during the Second Temple period. The inkwell probably belonged to a writer or merchant, the ICA added. The works were carried out under the leadership of the ICA, in collaboration with the Herzog Academic College in the West Bank.
