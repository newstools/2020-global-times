That still hurts me," he told AFP.With scientists still racing to find a working vaccine, governments are again forced into an uneasy balancing act: Virus controls slow the spread of the disease, but they hurt already reeling economies and businesses.The IMF earlier in 2020 warned that the economic upheaval could cause a "crisis like no other" as the world's GDP collapsed.Europe, hit hard by the first wave, is now facing another surge in cases, with Paris, London and Madrid all forced to introduce controls to slow infections threatening to overload hospitals.AFP
