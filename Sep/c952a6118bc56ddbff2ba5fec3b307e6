Huang was trying to repair a piece of colored silk cloth at CIFTIS.Huang told the Global Times the piece of silk requires months of work before completion, from dyeing, making up broken parts and mounting it. Only when a person has been trained for five to ten years can they handle real cultural relic restoration, Qian said. Chinese experts have been participating in restoration projects in Cambodia, Nepal and Mongolia, contributing to China’s efforts to help with the world’s cultural relic restoration. According to Zheng, the Leshi Cultural Relics Restoration Center has also seen many overseas collectors bringing Chinese cultural relics and artworks back to China for restoration. Repairing cultural relics not only involves museums but also individual collectors, he said.
