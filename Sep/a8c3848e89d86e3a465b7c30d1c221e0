During the pandemic, Chinese companies have actively explored the advantages of 5G technologies to introduce applications such as remote healthcare, education and working remotely, Wen said.Speaking at the forum, Zhao Dachun, deputy general manager of China Mobile, said there is a promising prospect for 5G’s incorporation into services trade, which is set to improve service experience, renovate the way services are provided and make services more readily available.Forum participants also urged global 5G cooperation to go deeper, and avoid decoupling, as marked US crackdowns on Chinese tech firms such as Huawei.Efforts are needed to deepen international exchanges and cooperation to push for continuous improvement in global 5G standards. Meanwhile, international collaboration in technology, standards and industry terms should be accompanied by enhanced cooperation in applications and joint efforts to seek business models for 5G integration into various industries in economies around the globe, the MIIT official said.As Sinisa Krajnovic, executive vice president and head of digital services in market area North East Asia at Ericsson, put it, 5G development won’t come from one company and only collaboration can unleash the potential of 5G.As of the end of June, 88 operators from 43 economies have launched 102 commercial 5G networks. The number of 5G base stations had surpassed 700,000 and there were more than 90 million 5G users, Yin said at the forum.Global Times
