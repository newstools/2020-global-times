An animals rights group is suing the US government to thwart a Connecticut aquarium's effort to get five new beluga whales, arguing in court that the aquatic animals would be harmed both from the trip from Canada and from being separated from other whales.

"They are highly social and intelligent animals who roam large distances in the wild. Captivity robs them on their most basic needs."Neither representatives for the aquarium nor the National Marine Fisheries Service were immediately available for comment.The proposed, five-year permit cited in the lawsuit, says the aquarium seeks the animals for noninvasive research.Newspaper headline: Lawsuit to stop Connecticut aquarium getting whales
