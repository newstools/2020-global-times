In Kenya, the coronavirus pandemic has dried up eco-tourism, cutting off sources of funding that help protect wildlife and pay an income to communities working to preserve nature.But forgiving a share of Kenya's hefty foreign debt, in exchange for the government devoting those resources to fighting climate change threats and biodiversity loss, could tackle several big problems at once, researchers said on Tuesday.

All might have good reason to consider such swaps, he told Reuters.Asset managers facing debt write-offs as a result of the coronavirus-linked downturn might opt to put them to productive use - which could both support ailing economies and reduce the need for more debt relief in the future, Steele said. Some investors that have made commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050 could also consider debt swaps as part of their broader mission, he added.Debt-for-nature and debt-for-climate swaps are a relatively new idea. The Seychelles in 2018 signed a $27 million deal brokered through The Nature Conservancy, with the freed-up cash going to set up a big marine reserve. Similar agreements might particularly suit other small island developing states in the Caribbean or Pacific with large debt, high climate vulnerability and rich biodiversity, he said.Â Money would be made available for climate and nature protection under a "results-based" payment system, Steele said.Newspaper headline: New idea proposed for wildlife
