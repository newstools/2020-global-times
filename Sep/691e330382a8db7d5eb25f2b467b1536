We were extremely honored and happy that Venice VR Expanded could be represented in this way in China and I'm going to go there in October for the Sandbox Festival," Reilhac said.Talking about the international co-productions with China, Reilhac noted that it is starting to happen on a broad scale, with companies from different countries collaborating with Chinese partners for financing and distribution.Reilhac said the market in China is so big that most Chinese companies making hardware and software or the people who produce content did not pay much attention to cooperation with foreigners. But things are changing now. "Now I see a big change and there is a bigger interest in being part of an international co-production," he said.Due to the pandemic, public places such as museums and cultural centers have had to resort to VR practices to offset the impact of limited access offered to visitors. And it is similar in the education and training industries."In China, there are certain manufacturers who are already working on very small headsets similar to glasses and that will be the future," said Reilhac.Newspaper headline: New worlds
