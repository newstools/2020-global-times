Meanwhile, it will cause uncertainties for the global electronic industry chain, according to Zhang.For example, as SMIC works closely with companies around the world, including in the US, the potential damage and disruption that the US restrictions will cause will be global."In the long run, it will also act as a wake-up call to promote the gradual rise of high-quality technology firms in China under pressure," Zhang noted.Suzhou Crystal Clear Chemical Co, a domestic enterprise that produces and sells ultra-pure chemical materials and other fine chemical products for the microelectronics industry, said in a filing on Tuesday that the company plans to import ASML lithography equipment from SK Hynix, a South Korean memory semiconductor supplier, through Singlest Technology, at a total cost of $110.25 million in order to develop high-end photoresist research and development projects for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing.In July, the State Council, China's cabinet, announced support policies for the IC and software sector, including massive tax cuts, financial aid and other support to help companies develop technologies and attract talent. The development of a third-generation semiconductor sector will reportedly also be included in the upcoming 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), which will guide China's economic and social policies.Newspaper headline: US curbs can’t halt China’s tech rise
