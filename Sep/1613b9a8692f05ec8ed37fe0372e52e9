The rights and freedoms, including freedom of the press, of speech, of publication, of association, of assembly and to demonstrate, which Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, are all protected by the legislation. "The groundless accusations made by those experts against the national security law are utterly untenable," it noted.

Even worse, they intend to abuse their mandate for political purpose, in violation of both the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council," that statement continued.The Chinese Mission to the UN said that in recent years, serious problems have been increasingly exposed in the special procedures system and more countries have voiced their concerns, noting that the credibility of the entire system has been seriously undermined due to wanton actions by certain mandate holders.The Chinese government stands firm in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, implementing the "one country, two systems" principle and opposing any external intervention in Hong Kong affairs, said the statement."No force, under any circumstances, can waver the determination and will of the Chinese government and people to safeguard national sovereignty and security and to maintain prosperity and stability in the HKSAR," it said.
