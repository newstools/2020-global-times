Negotiators for the EU and Britain are hoping for a breakthrough in trade talks this week, despite feuding over a controversial UK bill that threatens to scupper a post-Brexit deal.

Michel Barnier, the European Union's (EU) chief negotiator for relations with the UK, delivers a speech at a press conference in London, Britain, on July 23, 2020. Michel Barnier said Thursday that the UK's approach was making a post-Brexit trade deal "unlikely" as the sixth round of talks ended with little progress.

"If we have zero movement, the process will be in big trouble." Also on Monday senior EU and UK officials will meet in Brussels to try to find an understanding on the highly contentious issue of the withdrawal bill.EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic will meet his British counterpart Michel Gove as joint chair of an EU-UK coordination committee overseeing the implementation of the divorce agreement.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, whose country has more to lose than most if talks break down, said Brussels will not rubberstamp a trade agreement if London keeps threatening to breach its divorce.EU capitals were incensed by Johnson's decision to push an Internal Markets Bill in his own parliament that his own government admits would break international law by overwriting the withdrawal treaty.Brussels intends to launch legal action against the measure, but decided to continue talks on a trade deal as the bill passes through the Commons and House of Lords."When you have a family member who is going through a bit of a rough patch and loses it a bit, you can't cut him off from the rest of your life," an EU source said.The two sides are still divided on rules for a "level-playing field" of fair competition between companies, on state aid or subsidies for EU and UK firms and on access for EU boats to British fishing waters.Diplomats are hoping for significant progress in time for a summit of EU leaders later in the month, though expectations are that the wrangling could slip into November.Newspaper headline: Higher tariffs and quotas or not?
