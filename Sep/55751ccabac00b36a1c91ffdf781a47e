(photo: Xinhua/Yang Wenbin)Chinese Embassy in India on Thursday refuted Indian media's slander of a Chinese database"monitoring Indians,"saying the coverage about the company is totally untrue.Some Indian media recently claimed that the Chinese company Zhenhua Data in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, is "monitoring over 10,000 Indian individuals and entities including Indian politicians" with "links to the Chinese government."Responding to the misinformation and accusations, the embassy stated on its website on Thursday that Zhenhua Data, a privately owned company with no links to the Chinese government, has made a public response and made it clear that recent media reports are definitely inconsistent with the facts."Relevant report makes groundless accusations on the 'presumption of guilt,'purely trying to find excuses aiming to blame others,"the statement quoted the embassy's spokesperson Ji Rong as saying."Some forces with ulterior motives hype up the so-called 'China watching and manipulating data,' which is a part of planned and premeditated strategy to suppress, contain and smear China," Ji added.In the statement, the embassy reiterated that China has always been a staunch defender of cyber security. "We call on all parties to work with China to make tangible efforts to truly safeguard global data security and build a peaceful, secure, open and cooperative cyber space," it said.Earlier this week, Zhenhua Data denied to the Global Times the reports sayingit collects private information such as psychological profiles."There is nothing about the operations that are illegal or unreasonable," the company representative surnamed Sun told the Global Times on Monday, saying that the company collects information from public sources that are accessible to everyone, which is no different from its Western peers.
