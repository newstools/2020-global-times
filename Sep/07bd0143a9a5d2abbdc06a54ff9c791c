Some believed the statement showed the company's support for the employee by calling the post "legitimate", while others said the company was just handling the case cleverly, and its attitude was ambiguous. The War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression started on September 18, 1931, when Japanese troops began their invasion of Northeast China. Chinese people usually hold commemorative activities or send posts on social media in remembrance of this painful chapter of history. Global Times
