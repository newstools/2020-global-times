Food and drink outlets will also be restricted to table service.Some businesses have criticized the move, saying it will inflict more suffering on an already beleaguered industry.But customers outside cafes in central London were broadly supportive of the new rules if it meant avoiding another lockdown.Many nations in Europe were easing restrictions after largely overcoming initial outbreaks, but the resurgence of the virus has forced them to tighten curbs again.Spain's health minister on Tuesday called on Madrid residents to limit their movements and social contacts to the essential.Across Europe, hundreds of major events have been scaled back or cancelled and on Tuesday the most august of all gatherings, the Nobel prize ceremony, announced it had also succumbed to the pandemic.AFP
