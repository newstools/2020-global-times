Those firms badly need such a market to be the driving force of their business growth," said Zhu.In April, US coffee giant Starbucks updated its menu featuring plant-based meat substitutes from Beyond Meat, marking the company's official entry into the Chinese market, where such food products are still a novelty.Plant-based meat products are being supported by favorable policies, strong capital investment, and a bright industry outlook. There is a high threshold to enter the sector, which means it will bring good profits, he noted."But that is not enough - the consumption side is the key," said Zhu, adding that consumers' concerns over the health and safety of the products should be addressed.Shares of Beyond Meat rose 2.6 percent in pre-market trading on Tuesday on the US NASDAQ board.
