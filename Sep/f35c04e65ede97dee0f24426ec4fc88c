The breakthrough provides a promising solution to counter threats in the area of communication security.Â Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences revealed at the 2020 ZGC Forum on Saturday that they have implemented the world's first QSDC system.The present system can operate with a communication rate of 4kb/s at a distance of 10 kilometers, bringing QSDC further toward practical applications.QSDC was proposed by Long Guilu, adjunct member of Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences in 2000.As an important branch of quantum communication, secret information can be directly transmitted without key distribution, which eliminates further security loopholes associated with key storage and attacks, according to Gui.
