Feminist activists and family members of the missing ramped up a protest at the main offices of Mexico's human rights commission on Monday, after occupying the building on September 2 to draw attention to kidnapped persons and attacks targeting women.

People watch the light show for the upcoming celebrations of the 210th anniversary of the Mexican Independence Day, at Zocalo Square in Mexico City, Mexico, on September 1.

Standing in front of one of the painted-over portraits, one feminist activist denounced Lopez Obrador for what she described as his misplaced sense of outrage.More than 70,000 people have been reported missing in Mexico since the country's military was deployed in 2006 to confront organized crime. Most are believed to have been kidnapped.Newspaper headline: For justice, feminist activists occupy Mexico offices
