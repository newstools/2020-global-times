The new rules on Saturday came as the US stepped up its crackdowns on Chinese companies.  Citing national security concerns, the US government has imposed sanctions on more than 300 Chinese companies ranging from tech giants like Huawei to construction firms to Xinjiang textile factories.The US Commerce Department reiterated on Friday that it would ban Chinese mobile apps WeChat and TikTok from US app stores. The Trump administration has also ordered a prohibition on the sale of microchips to Chinese telecom firm Huawei.Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
