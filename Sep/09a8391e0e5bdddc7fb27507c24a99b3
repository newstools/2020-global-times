Photo: ICA Saudi court on Monday overturned five death sentences over journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder, in a final ruling that was condemned by his fiancee and slammed by a UN expert as a "parody of justice."Eight unnamed defendants were handed jail terms of between seven and 20 years in a verdict that comes after Khashoggi's sons "pardoned" the killers in May, paving the way for a less severe punishment.The court ruling underscores Saudi efforts to draw a line under the October 2018 murder as the kingdom seeks to reboot its international image ahead of November's G20 summit in Riyadh.The closed-door trial of 11 suspects ended in December with five unnamed people sentenced to death and three others handed jail terms totaling 24 years over the killing.But the family's pardon paved the way for Monday's reduced sentences, including clemency for the five people on death row.None of the defendants were named in what was described as the final court ruling on the murder, which triggered an international outcry and tarnished the global reputation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Turkey on Monday said the Saudi court ruling did not meet global expectations.Â "We still don't know what happened to Khashoggi's body, who wanted him dead or if there were local collaborators - which casts doubt on the credibility of the legal proceedings," tweeted Fahrettin Altun, Communications Director at the Turkish presidency.AFP
