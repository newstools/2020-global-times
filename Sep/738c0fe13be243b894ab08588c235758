Considering the structure of Serbian energy imports and the fact that Serbia and Russia are very closely linked by cooperation in the field of natural gas, the Washington agreement advised Serbia and Kosovo to diversify their energy sources. Serbia has deep cooperation and firm relations with China and Russia, and the solid foundation will not be shaken by the US, Wang said.Some Western media have claimed Serbia has walked toward the West after the spat with Russia over a senior Russian official's Facebook post. However, after Russian President Vladimir Putin issued an apology to Vucic, Vucic said the two countries have good relations and for him the incident was a "passing, unimportant incident," according to BBC.
