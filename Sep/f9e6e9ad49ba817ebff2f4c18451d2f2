The World Health Organization endorsed on Saturday a protocol for testing African herbal medicines as potential treatments for the coronavirus and other epidemics.COVID-19 has raised the issue of using traditional medicines to battle contemporary diseases, and the endorsement clearly encouraged testing with criteria similar to those used for molecules developed by labs in Asia, Europe or the Americas.

WHO's partners are the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the African Union Commission for Social Affairs."The onset of COVID-19, like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, has highlighted the need for strengthened health systems and accelerated research and development programs, including on traditional medicines," Tumusiime said.He did not refer specifically to the Madagascar drink COVID-Organics, also called CVO, that Rajoelina has pitched as a cure for the virus, however.It has been widely distributed in Madagascar and sold to several other countries, mainly in Africa.In May, WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti told media that African governments had committed in 2000 to taking "traditional therapies" through the same clinical trials as other medication."I can understand the need, the drive to find something that can help," Moeti said. "But we would very much like to encourage this scientific process in which the governments themselves made a commitment."Newspaper headline: Treatments from nature acknowledged
