Studying the design for power integration with such vehicles is key to supporting the future development and application of the space-Earth shuttle system, which is expected to significantly enhance China’s capability to freely enter and exit from space.China launched a reusable spacecraft on September 4 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center using a Long March-2F launch vehicle. After two days of orbital flight, the vehicle made a safe landing on the designated site on September 6. However, no details on the spacecraft’s measurements – not even its name – have been made public so far.Despite keeping a low profile, news of the reusable spacecraft gained a great deal of attention and led to speculation, with many, such as space.com, the New York-based source of space news, believing that the flight mission was related to China's space plane project.Many foreign reports and Chinese netizens have been drawing comparisons between the unnamed vehicle – if it is a fixed wing space plane – and the X-37B space plane owned by the US Air Force.Nuclear power spacecraft and engineering applications are also among the top topics, aiming to ease human exploration across the solar system.
