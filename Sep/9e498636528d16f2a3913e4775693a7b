Earlier this year, the Pentagon moved to cut 15.5 million U.S. dollars in funding for the publication from the defense budget.Trump's move came as the White House is facing a firestorm after a report in The Atlantic that, citing unnamed officials, said the president disparaged fallen U.S. service members as "losers" and "suckers."Trump vehemently denied the report, calling the unnamed sources making the claim "low-lifes" and "liars."
