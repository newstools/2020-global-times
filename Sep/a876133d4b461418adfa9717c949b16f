Maintaining the healthy development of the market is good for both parties," Bai said.Experts also noted that conducting anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations is a standard trade investigative practice under WTO rules.According to Chinese statistics, China's imports of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol monoalkyl ethers from the US rose 68.6 percent between 2016 and 2019.Imports from the US increased from 18,000 tons in 2016 to 24,000 tons in 2017.
