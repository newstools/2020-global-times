It hopes that by creating a "favorable" atmosphere for the upcoming election, its buyout of the Chinese video sharing app TikTok would become smooth under the Trump administration, which has cracked down on the Chinese app citing so-called national security reasons. "Where the 'hacking group' works and maintains its business operations cannot be used to jump to conclusions such as saying the group has 'national power' behind it," An Jincheng, research associate of the Cybersecurity Association of China, told the Global Times on Friday.Microsoft's warning seems to suggest that the hacking group in China has some level of connection with the country's government or maybe other corporations, aiming to intervene in the US' election activities, however, these claims "lack evidence and do not make sense," said An."The hacking group might just be an illegal group that operates in China and must therefore be brought to justice," he noted.China is one of the world's largest victims of cyber-attacks. On the other hand, the US has continuously suffered from telecom espionage, Chinese officials said.Amid the US' crucial presidential election period, it would be in the best interests of the US to join the international community to collaborate and address cyber security issues, instead of accusing other countries without solid evidence, An noted.
