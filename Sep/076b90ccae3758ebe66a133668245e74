Demonstrators march on Wednesday in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The city declared a state of emergency curfew after a fourth night of civil unrest after the shooting of Jacob Blake on Sunday. Photo: AFPUS President Donald Trump Tuesday took his tough law and order message to Kenosha, the latest US city roiled by the police shooting of a black man, as he branded recent anti-racism protests acts of "domestic terror" by violent mobs.Trump has been hoping for months to shift the election battle against Democrat Joe Biden from a verdict on his widely panned coronavirus pandemic response to what he sees as far more comfortable territory of law and order.And in the Wisconsin city of Kenosha, in upheaval since a white police officer shot 29-year-old African-American Jacob Blake in front of his three young sons, the Republican found his mark."These are not acts of peaceful protest but really domestic terror," Trump said after touring damage in the city, describing multiple nights of angry demonstrations last week that left two people dead.Crowds lined the barricaded streets where the president's motorcade passed, with Trump supporters on one side and Black Lives Matter protesters on the other, yelling at one another from a distance and in sometimes tense face-to-face encounters."Thank you for saving our town," read the sign of one supporter along the road. "Not my president," read another.Under heavy security that blocked off the road, Trump visited a burned out store where he told the owners "we'll help you rebuild.""These gentlemen did a fantastic job," he said, in reference to law enforcement units that quelled the violent protests."This is a great area, a great state," Trump said, adding later that his administration was committing at least $47 million to Wisconsin law enforcement, small businesses and public safety programs.Trump suggested in Washington that a meeting with the Blake family was possible during his high-profile trip but it did not materialize.A microcosm of the racial and ideological tensions of the Trump era, Kenosha has seen Black Lives Matter protests, riots, and the arrival of armed, white vigilantes, culminating in an incident in which a militia enthusiast, Kyle Rittenhouse, allegedly shot dead two people and badly injured another.Democrats and police reform advocates view Kenosha as a symbol of institutional racism.They see Rittenhouse, a Trump supporter, as emblematic of right-wing militias that are increasingly brazen about brandishing weaponry in political settings.Trump, however, came with a different priority: countering what he has repeatedly described as the "anarchy" in Democratic-led cities.Trump has refused to condemn the growing presence of armed vigilantes on the streets, calling the alleged killings by Rittenhouse "an interesting situation."AFP
