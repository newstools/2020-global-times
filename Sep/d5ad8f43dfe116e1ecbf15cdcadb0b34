Those who believe they are strong enough to ignore and break international rules will eventually be abandoned as time goes by, Wang said.Wang called on all countries to stick to peaceful development, stay true to the values of equality and justice, fight the pandemic through solidarity, and maintain the direction of openness and cooperation.
