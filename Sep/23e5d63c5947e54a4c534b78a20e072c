The politically motivated 5G ban, however, hurt the local market's potential as a rewarding investment destination, Fu Liang, a Beijing-based telecom industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.It's reasonable for Huawei to withdraw gradually from the market, Fu said, and the resulting cuts in R&D investment and jobs will further batter the local economy.Australia's exports to China plunged 26.2 percent year-on-year to $8.81 billion in August, Chinese customs data showed. In the first eight months of the year, its exports to China shrank 7.5 percent to $75.73 billion.The 5G ban has resulted in Australia, once billed as an important market for Huawei, being jettisoned, said Ma Jihua, a veteran telecom industry analyst.With Australian exporters relying heavily on the Chinese market, Huawei's investment rollback will inevitably increase pressure on Canberra, prompting interest groups within the country to weigh the consequent losses to the Australian economy and prevent bilateral ties from being held hostage by unbridled hostility, Ma told the Global Times on Tuesday.It won't be easy for Australia to find an equally capable 5G solution provider to fill the gap being left by Huawei, according to Fu, who said Australia's plight ought to be a wake-up call for the other members of the Five Eyes alliance, especially Canada and New Zealand, against following the US at the cost of their own interests.It's increasingly the case that the Trump administration's reckless clampdown on Chinese technologies is distancing the US from its allies, Fu commented, citing Germany and France, which haven't moved to rip out Huawei equipment.In the case of the UK, a U-turn led to a ban on new Huawei 5G kit that won't be enforced until the end of the year, or after the November election. This could be seen as an indication of the UK's continued equivocation, the analyst said.
