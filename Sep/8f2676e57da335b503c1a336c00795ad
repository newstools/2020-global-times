A quarter of school-age children in Lebanon's capital risk missing out on school after August's deadly port explosion, the International Rescue Committee aid group warned on Monday.

Lebanese firefighters try to put out a fire that broke out at Beirut's port area on Thursday. Thick black columns of smoke rose into the sky, as the army said it had engulfed a warehouse storing engine oil and vehicle tires.
