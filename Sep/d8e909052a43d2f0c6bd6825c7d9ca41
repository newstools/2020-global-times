Thirteen eye-catching sculptures can be seen throughout the park. These collaboratively-created artworks make ingenious use of materials such metal, wood and even industrial waste. The park is named for the Sobre la Armonía workshop, a get-together event between Chinese and Spanish artists. The first workshop was held in Barcelona in 2018. In 2019, the event moved to Chengdu, during which time the international art park was established. The park has the focus to use art to rejuvenate the development of Chengdu's rural area. It is the city's first international art park.
