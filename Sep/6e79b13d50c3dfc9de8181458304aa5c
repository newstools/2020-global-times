A fighter with the Syrian Democratic Forces fires a mortar shell toward a part of Baghouz where remaining Islamic State (IS) group fighters are holding out in their last position, in the countryside of the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor on Monday. A shroud of black smoke covered the last redoubt as forces battled holdout jihadists.

And the aim of the Indonesian text was to encourage actions that would combat recidivism among those who joined extremists.But mostly the other countries have preferred that their nationals stand trial and face punishment in the countries where their crimes were committed, putting the onus mainly on Iraq to deal with them."The Indonesian resolution before us, supposedly designed to reinforce international action on counterterrorism, was worse than no resolution at all," said US UN Ambassador Kelly Craft. But another diplomat, insisting on anonymity, said the use of the veto had "become very cheap," adding that it was "very damaging" to cross-Atlantic relations.AFP
