On Wednesday late evening India's junior railways minister Suresh Angadi died due to COVID-19, officials said. The 65-year-old Angadi died nearly two weeks after he tested positive for coronavirus infection. He was admitted to AIIMS in Delhi after his condition worsened. Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized on the need to increase focus on "effective testing, tracing, treatment and surveillance" to bring COVID-19 outbreak in the country under control. "Effective messaging is necessary due to the asymptomatic nature of the infection which may lead to doubts about the efficacy of tests," Modi said during his virtual meet with chief ministers of seven states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. "In such a situation, rumours may rise. It might raise doubts in the minds of the people that testing is bad. Some people also make mistake of underestimating the severity of the infection." Modi laid emphasis on developing the habit of using face masks on a daily basis. He also announced that the limit of using the State Disaster Response Fund for COVID-19 specific infrastructure has been increased from 35 percent to 50 percent.
