This program is not for Nairobi alone but for all Kenyans who are skilled and are working in the jua kali sector," he said.The president challenged local artisans to ensure they assemble and supply desks that meet the highest quality standards and advised project beneficiaries to form saving societies to grow their earnings from the project.The launch of the project came after the government released guidelines for reopening of the schools where learners, teachers and school workers will be required to wear face masks at all times, maintain physical distance and check for COVID-19 symptoms daily once learning resumes.
