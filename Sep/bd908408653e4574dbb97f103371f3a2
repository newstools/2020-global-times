The first black woman is on a major party presidential ticket, Americans of all races are showing their support for the Black Lives Matter movement and at the same time white nationalists are ramping up recruiting efforts and public activism.That nationwide backing for the US' stated goal of equal rights for all has been met by a rise in hate-related activities and is part of a decades-long pattern in the US, six scholars and historians say - any expansion of civil rights for a minority group leads to a rise in intolerance."Each wave of civil rights progress brings us a little closer to real equity, but there will always be backlash from those who feel threatened by that progress," said Cynthia Miller-Idriss, director of research with the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University in Washington. People who feel vulnerable to change become "eager to recruit and radicalize support to slow things down, even if by use of violence or radicalized propaganda," she said.After the first black president, Barack Obama, was elected in 2008, the number of hate groups "ballooned," Miller-Idriss said, just as Ku Klux Klan (KKK) activity grew again after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Ed. decision desegregating schools, and during the 1960s civil rights movement. Backlashes happened after women got the right to vote, and as LGBTQ rights expanded, too.One of the things that makes this moment so heated is that there's been a bigger embrace by politicians, businesses and white people in general supporting racial justice movements than in the past, historians and civil rights experts said.The US rests on the "great social challenge of creating a successful harmonious, multiracial democracy," said Simon Clark, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress (CAP). The backlash against that accelerated during the Black Lives Matter protests and "is both a political one and a violent, social one," he said.Protests against excessive use of force by police and racism swept the US, and the world, the summer of 2020 after a black man, George Floyd, died on May 25 while a white Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer kneeled on his neck.The latest police shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 23, has sparked more protests that have sometimes become violent.Two white nationalist groups, who want an independent state for whites, told Reuters their numbers are also increasing, which Reuters could not independently confirm. The National Socialist Movement Corporation and the ShieldWall Network said many of the new prospects reject the Black Lives Matter protesters mainly out of fear that the demonstrations will impose on their freedoms, such as the right to bear arms."I've got guns. I've got a lot of bullets and an armor, too. And if people come down my street looking for trouble, I am going to fight it," Burt Colucci, self-described commander of the Corporation, said a prospective recruit told him in a recent phone call.

 The New York-based Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has documented 3,566 "extremist propaganda incidents" and events in 2020, compared to 2,704 in the same period of 2019. Almost 80 percent of 2020's cases involve white nationalist ideology, the civil rights advocacy organization found. Anti-Semitic incidents and plots and attacks of terrorism among others made up the rest, the ADL said.March in WashingtonPatriot Front, a white nationalist group, marched in Washington in February, and flyers and leaflets advertising the group have been found on college campuses from Arizona to Vermont in recent months. White nationalist groups posted messages on Facebook this summer advocating bringing guns to Black Lives Matter protests, and staged demonstrations in Florida and Pennsylvania in July.While the ethnic and racial diversity of the US is growing, whites remain a majority, about 60 percent of all Americans, according to Pew Research Center analysis published in 2019.One-third of eligible voters in the November 3 elections will be nonwhite, according to Pew, up from one-quarter in 2000.Most Americans say they embrace diversity, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll in 2019 about race, society, and their political engagement. Sixty-three percent said the statement "I prefer to live in a community with people who come from diverse cultures" reflects their point of view.Among registered Democrats, that affirmative answer jumped to 78 percent, while among Republicans it dropped to 45 percent.

Black Lives Matter protesters help restrain members from confrontations in front of the Louisville Metro Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, the US on Saturday. Photo: AFP'Hear the rage'America has been at similar crossroads before, the scholars and historians interviewed by Reuters say.The KKK is the oldest and most violent of white extremist organizations, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) civil rights advocacy group. The KKK used violence against black people in Southern states, particularly to deny them the newly won right to vote. During the early years of the civil rights movement, a number of monuments honoring the war heroes of the Confederacy, the slavery-supporting states that lost the Civil War, were erected in the South.Newspaper headline: Backlash of hatred
