A total of 15 films including The Climbers, Sheep Without A Shepherd, My People, My Country and The Captain will compete for the award.Chinese actor Wu Jing, star of action blockbuster Wolf Warrior 2 and sci-fi hit The Wandering Earth, is one of the ambassadors of the festival in 2020. Speaking to media, the star described film as a beam of light in the darkness that can arouse people's pursuit of beauty, kindness and honesty. The virus crisis has canceled, delayed or forced online many international film festivals around the world including the Cannes, San Sebastian, Toronto and Busan film festivals.With China having achieved great strides in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, domestic film festivals and cinemas have gradually resumed their former prosperity, providing hope for the global film industry, CRI Online reported on Sunday.
