Rescuers faced a race against time to save nearly 200 whales stuck in a remote Australian harbor on Tuesday, hoping to prevent the toll of 90 dead from rising further after managing to free "a small number" of the stranded mammals.

But there were hopes Tuesday that early rescue efforts were already paying off, according to the official leading the operation."We have now freed a small number successfully that appear to have stayed out at sea, and are now scaling up that approach," Parks and Wildlife Service manager Nic Deka said.Though mass whale strandings occur relatively often in Tasmania, such a large group has not been seen in the area.Newspaper headline: Pilot whale rescue efforts still underway
