So I bought a ticket for day one," one netizen wrote on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Thursday.

Although he has said audiences should feel the film rather than understand it, I felt uncomfortable sitting in the cinema in a witless state," one netizen commented in a review on Douban.Shi Wenxue, a cultural critic and teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, commented that Tenet is more complicated than the director's former works."The reason is that there is not much foreshadowing during the first half of the film and the third act reveals too many secrets, causing confusion for the audience," he told the Global Times on Sunday.Compared with Inception as well as Interstellar, Shi said he thinks Tenet provides a better answer to present reality, which is to "protect the present even from the future."
