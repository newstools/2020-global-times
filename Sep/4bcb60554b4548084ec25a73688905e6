Myanmar signed the memorandum of understanding on cooperation with China's Lancang-Mekong Water Resources Cooperation Center in 2019. The official expressed confidence in joining the scheme, stressing that Mekong River resource problems cannot be solved by one country alone. Khin Ma Ma Myo, a professor of international relations from The University of Rangoon, also suggested to the Global Times that Myanmar attaches more importance to the LMC "special fund projects," which are mainly targeted at projects urgently needed in the development of the six countries within the LMC. Myanmar's emergency repair on the Bagan Stupa has been included in this project.Sommad Pholsena, Laos' Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, told the Global Times that it was China that timely released water from dams to the lower Mekong reaches in 2016, when the Mekong River countries encountered the worst drought in 100 years."China's [efforts] effectively alleviated the drought in the involved Mekong countries," Pholsena commented. The cooperation between Chinese and Laotian water and meteorological departments has also achieved remarkable results in these years, which has enhanced Laos' scientific and technological level in water and meteorology, as well as its abilities of responding to climate change and preventing and mitigating natural disasters, he said.The statements of some US officials are groundless, said Thai newspaper Than Setthakit's editor-in-chief Chaiwat, noting that the cooperation between China and lower Mekong countries has a positive impact on these countries. China has kept maintaining close communication with countries in this area, making joint efforts in hydrologic information sharing and hydrologic collaboration against floods and droughts, Chaiwat said.
