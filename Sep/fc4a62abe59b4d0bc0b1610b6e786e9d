Britain on Wednesday insisted it would maintain its foreign aid commitments, as its flagship overseas development agency was shut and merged with the foreign ministry.

But Boris Johnson's government has dismissed concerns, arguing UK aid needs to be allied more closely to geopolitical threats.Critics of Britain's 15 billion pound ($19 billion) foreign aid budget, led by right-wing newspapers, argue that the funding regime is often wasteful and open to corruption.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the new department would involve using Britain's "diplomatic levers and aid expertise" for an international response to global threats.He announced 119 million pound in new funding to tackle the coronavirus outbreak and famines affecting more than 6 million people in the world's poorest countries.Raab has also appointed Britain's first special envoy for famine protection and humanitarian affairs to work with donors, UN agencies, NGOs and others to prevent famine."Coronavirus and famine threaten millions in some of the world's poorest countries, and give rise to direct problems that affect the UK, including terrorism and migration flows," he said."'Global Britain,' as a force for good in the world, is leading by example and bringing the international community together to tackle these deadly threats, because it's the right thing to do and it protects British interests."Britain takes over the presidency of the G7 group of leading economies in 2021 andCOP26 inÂ  November 2021.
