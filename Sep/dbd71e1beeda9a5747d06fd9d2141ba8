Huang said she had applied for her student visa at the Consulate General of the United States in Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning Province in July but the application was canceled without giving specific reasons."It is difficult for us to obtain visas. There is no way for us [Chinese students] to go to the US to study," Huang said.Huang was not alone.The latest statistics from US authorities showed that only 145 US student visas (F-1) were issued to Chinese mainland residents in July this year. In contrast, it approved more than 20,000 visas for mainland students last July.

I'm still looking forward to experiencing the local campus life," Huang said.Most of her courses are still based on the online courses of US universities in addition to the option of attending in-person courses offered by the International Campus, Zhejiang University. Her earliest online class begins at 8 pm Beijing Time and latest class finishes at 2:30 in the morning."I think this experience will help develop our "self-management" skills. Due to some 'jet lag-like' feelings, my work-life balance will need some adjustment," she said.Eric Yang, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at Wenzhou-Kean University, a Chinese-American jointly established higher education institution in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province told the Global Times that they have received hundreds of applications from Chinese students who were unable to travel to the US to resume their study at Wenzhou-Kean University."It's a good option for those who wanted to study abroad. They can complete their study in China a similar 'western curriculum' and international environment," Yang said.Many young Chinese students feel the same way. They have commented that they are lucky that they could still enjoy a normal campus life rather than studying alone at home or from a socially-distanced dorm room on the other side of the world.Li Feiyang completed his computer science undergraduate study at UIUC and is about to resume graduate study at the International Campus, Zhejiang University."With everyone in the same boat and unable to live a 'normal life' as before, I'm very satisfied with this option," Li said.As the coronavirus began spreading across the US in March, his college announced that it would conduct all its classes online. One of his scheduled internship programs has also been cancelled after most companies began working remotely rather than in their offices.At the end of May, Li took a flight to China seeking an internship and learned about the ongoing local education option in July."After all, in-person classes and online classes are completely different. If I stayed in the US, I would have to stay in my dormitory every day and wouldn't be able to go outside and meet new friends," Li said.Uncertain outlook China is the largest source of international students in the world. Over 369,000 Chinese students studied in the US in the 2018-19 academic year, accounting for 33.7 percent of all international students, according to the Institute of International Education. But the disruptions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the US' constant shift in policies have caused many Chinese students to reassess their future study plans in the country.In early September, more than 1,000 Chinese students and visiting scholars in the US had their visas suddenly revoked by the US State of Department under a presidential measure by the Trump administration. For most of these students intending to continue their study in the US, their future in the country began to look uncertain given rising China-US tensions."I will adjust my plans depending on the US' attitude toward Chinese students. It depends on if they remove their visa restrictions or if the pandemic subsides," Huang said.Other students claimed that they will start looking for "backup options" as they begin to choose the destination of their overseas studies.Tu Leiming, a senior student majoring in marketing at Wenzhou-Kean University, told the Global Times that although most students still want to study abroad, their first choice may no longer be the US."The current environment in the US is not so welcoming for international students as any presidential policy may be a blow to the international student community," Tu said. Chen Xingyu, an English major from Wenzhou-Kean University, told the Global Times that although she still plans to apply for a master's degree in the US, she is also applying for universities in the UK as a backup option.Newspaper headline: Chinese students study 'abroad' in China this fall semester
