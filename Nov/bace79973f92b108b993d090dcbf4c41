However, I halted imports from India after the pandemic got out of control in the country," Cao Jie, a Shanghai-based India ribbon fish processor, told the Global Times on Sunday.The temporary ban on some Indian seafood is completely expected given India's poor handling of the pandemic, experts said."China's move to suspend some Indian imports is a reasonable one to protect its people, not retaliation," Zhao said. "It is almost impossible for India to have the capacity to carry out strict tests of its seafood products before exporting them to China as the pandemic is 'out of control' in the country." He predicted that the impact of COVID-19 on Indian seafood exports may continue for some time.India had reported more than 8.8 million coronavirus cases as of Sunday, more than any other country besides the US.Newspaper headline: China halts Indian cuttlefish imports after virus found on packaging
