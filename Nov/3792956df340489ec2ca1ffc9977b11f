Historically, Africa has had to wait too long to get medicines and vaccines that the Global North long took for granted for many reasons -- including a lack of local data from Africa," said Tian Johnson, head of African Alliance and founding member of the Vaccine Advocacy Resource Group.He pointed out that they want to ensure that civil society and communities are meaningfully involved in vaccine research, development and access."The world desperately needs effective vaccines and medicines to treat COVID-19 and the quest to develop these has pushed science to find new and faster ways of finding them. But in the rush to find effective solutions to COVID-19, we cannot afford to leave communities behind, and their involvement cannot be an afterthought for researchers," Johnson said.South Africa is now one of nine countries, including the United States, Argentina and Mexico, which are testing the vaccine.
