Also, the leaders vowed to continue implement the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) to provide "maximum support" to ease debt burdens for eligible countries. "As a main platform for global leaders to coordinate on responses to world crises, the G20 has played an important role in the fight against the epidemic since the special summit in March," He Weiwen, a former senior trade official and a senior fellow of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday, adding that though concrete actions remain to be seen, "it has no doubt offered the world a positive direction."As the deadly virus made its way across the globe in March, the G20 convened a special summit where leaders agreed to cooperate in the battle against the epidemic and coordinate economic policies to help the teetering global economy. In total, the G20 has contributed over $21 billion to support global health systems and the hunt for a vaccine, offered over $14 billion in debt relief for developing countries and injected $11 trillion to support the global economy, according to an official statement.However, despite these contributions, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage many parts of the world with constant record-breaking new cases, including in the US and Europe. The global economy is estimated by the IMF to contract 4.4 percent in 2020, which requires more robust actions by the G20 economies, experts said.  "While the message from the G20 is positive, the outcomes are mostly consensus in principle rather than concrete action plans. It remains to be seen what specific actions the G20 members will take, because we need concrete actions," Huo Jianguo, vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.He Weiwen also said that compared to the swift actions in response to the 2008 global financial crisis, "there is still a lot to be done this time around because the crisis we face now is much worse than in 2009."Following the global financial crisis, the G20 convened its first leaders' summit in the US and came up with what has been described as the largest and most coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus that helped avert a possible economic depression.What happened since was a major shift in the US' foreign policies, especially since Trump came to power. When COVID-19 hit, the world was already facing several crises caused in no small part by Trump's toxic unilateral and protectionist approach, even as other countries like China have been promoting multilateralism and free trade. That shifting dynamic was on vivid display at the G20 this year. Shifting rolesXi, who had just attended three major regional and global meetings over the past week, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting on Friday, delivered several speeches at the G20 summit, highlighting China's resolve in tackling global issues - climate change and poverty alleviation, after speaking of China's commitment to promote global cooperation in fighting the COVID-19 and helping save the global economy on Saturday.In a speech at the G20s opening on Saturday, the Chinese President reiterated that China will honor its pledge to make vaccines a global public good, urged more countries to join a China-proposed mechanism on mutual recognition of health certificates with a QR code to allow global travel to resume, and vowed to increase the level of debt suspension and relief for countries facing particular difficulties. Then on Sunday, in a speech at a session on protecting the planet, Xi reaffirmed China's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to contribute to addressing climate change. At another speech on Sunday night, Xi focused on poverty alleviation across the globe, calling for more financial, digital support for developing countries and vulnerable groups."Without a doubt, China has become more adoptive and more influential at these global platforms, mostly not just because of its domestic success but also because of its commitment to talk global issues," while the US, under Trump, has shown "no interest" in global issues, Huo said.Trump also attended the G20 summit, which could be among his last appearance at a multilateral event as Joe Biden is projected to win the US presidential election, but his attendance drew more mockery than admiration, as he tweeted about election politics during the opening session and skipped a session on pandemic preparedness to go golfing at his club. While Trump might remain influential in US domestic politics, his departure from the White House will be a boon for multilateralism, as Biden has shown steady support for multilateralism and he could take measures to push for cooperation, experts said."Particularly, Biden has made fighting COVID-19 his top priority, which would require global cooperation, therefore, he is very likely to pursue global cooperation at the G20 and other multilateral platforms," He said.
