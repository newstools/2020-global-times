Alibaba has turned the festival into a prolonged seasonal shopping gala – divided into two promotional periods – to draw more participation of consumers and businesses.Taobao launched presales on October 21, and in the first hour of the pre-sale period the number of participants was double that of last year. Pre-sales posted by more than 300 brands exceeded last year's sales for all of November 11, according to Taobao.In the post COVID-19 era, the shift to online-based consumption has become inexorable, as digital platforms evolve to appeal to digital-savvy Chinese mainland consumers. Zhao Ping, vice president of the international trade department at the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, predicts that sales during Double Eleven shopping festival may even expand at a faster pace than the US' Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotional events, even as the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout earlier in the year bit into Chinese consumers' disposable incomes.
