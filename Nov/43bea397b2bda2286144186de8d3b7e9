Bern says it will meet the target mainly through domestic measures, but under the agreement, Switzerland can offset its emissions through projects in other countries, which will then count toward its reduction target. Switzerland signed a similar deal with Peru on October 20, a move it called "the first agreement of its kind in the world.""With this agreement, Switzerland is setting a standard for international climate projects that meet stringent environmental protection requirements, while also respecting international standards for the protection of human rights."It also commits both parties to use a method that prevents double counting of emission reductions. The criteria will be monitored continuously for the duration of the climate projects."Glaciers in the Swiss Alps are in steady decline, losing 2 percent of their volume.
