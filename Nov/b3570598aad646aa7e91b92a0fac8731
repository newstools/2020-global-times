Donors demanded an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan on Tuesday as they pledged around $12 billion in aid over four years - but tied their money to civil rights being upheld in peace talks with the Taliban.

The international community must continue aiding Afghanistan or risk "disastrous consequences," UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi urged on Monday as a donor conference kicked off in Geneva.

With the final figures still to be collated, donors had pledged more than $3 billion for 2021.Annual commitments are expected to stay at that level, dependent on Kabul's performance, said Finnish development minister Ville Skinnari, who cochaired the conference."This would amount to some $12 billion during four years."The previous 2016 conference in Brussels raised $15.2 billion.Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar said the new figure was "impressive," given countries are struggling with the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.Hailing the cease-fire call, he said: "The Taliban must hear that: It's not just the Afghan people who demand a cease-fire. It's the whole of the world community.""The Taliban do know that there is no military solution to this problem," he added.The Taliban and the Afghan government have been engaged in peace talks in Qatar since September 12 but no progress has been announced so far. However, the negotiations in Doha are ready to advance to the next stage, sources close to the talks said Tuesday.Newspaper headline: New figure from donors ‘impressive’
