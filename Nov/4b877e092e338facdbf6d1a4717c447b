Majorities in 43 out of 50 states named the following three: racism in 17 states, crime and violence in 18 states, and health care in 8 states.The researchers also found clear partisan, age and racial/ethnic differences. Democrats and independents included racism, climate change and health care in their most frequently mentioned problems. Republicans, too, cited health care in their top five, but also crime and violence, abortion and the economy.African Americans are far more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to name racism and police brutality as the top problem for the country, while white respondents are most likely to name the economy or health care as their No. 2 problem after COVID-19, according to the survey.
