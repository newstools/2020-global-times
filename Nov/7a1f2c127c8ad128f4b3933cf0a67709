US President Donald Trump displays an Executive Order on healthcare after signing as guests applaud, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House Thursday, in Washington DC. Trump moved to undermine Obamacare late Thursday by cutting off subsidies to health insurance companies for low-income patients.

"The part has been taken out, and the plane has not crashed." AFP
