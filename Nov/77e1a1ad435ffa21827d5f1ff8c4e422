According to a September Analysis by the American Hospital Association, studies have shown severe and in some cases worse shortages of PPE since the beginning of this year.The White House earlier said it would put the nation on track for "nearly 100 percent domestically supplied" masks by the end of 2020, even though the country is still far short of the 3.5 billion masks needed this year, National Public Radio reported in September.Given the challenging tasks ahead, experts believe it is likely that the US will import large volumes of Chinese PPE and learn from China's successful experience in epidemic prevention and control.Instead of seeking to harm China via high tariffs, the US should seek more cooperation with Chinese companies in the battle against the virus, experts said."Masks are not mandatory in the US, so the consumption of masks is not very high. But if the containment measures were to be upgraded under Biden, consumption would rise rapidly and new orders would flood into companies already certified by the US government," Bai Yu, president of the Medical Appliances Branch of the China Medical Pharmaceutical Material Association, told the Global Times.The production capacity of surgical masks in China is now hundreds of millions per day. As production capacity rose, prices fell, with a current level of only 1 yuan ($0.15) compared with 3 yuan in April."The cost and production advantages of Chinese masks are stronger than those of the US, and masks exported from China to the US are even cheaper than masks produced locally purchased by Americans," said Bai, and under Biden, the US is likely to increase the efficiency of export declarations from Chinese mask manufacturers in an effort to increase imports of masks from China.
