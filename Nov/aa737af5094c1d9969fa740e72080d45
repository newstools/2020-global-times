Instead, their attention has already moved on to president-elect Joe Biden.

Back home, Trump was criticized for this.He Weiwen, a former senior trade official and an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, said that Trump's appearance will be more of an existence-validating show-up for the outgoing US president, as he is by no means interested in APEC and actually stands on the opposite of what the APEC stands for. "With his days as US president entering a countdown mode, this show-up would only be a validation. What he said, whether some supportive message to the APEC or more likely, his old talk of 'America First,' will be of little significance to an audience preoccupied with something larger," He told the Global Times on Friday.With the economic rise of East Asia, the role of the US in APEC has been significantly reduced, Su Hao, founding director of the Center for Strategic and Peace Studies at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times."Whereas Washington can no longer dominate the economy of East Asia, its interest in APEC is declining," Su said. "But the country is still reluctant to give up because this would be detrimental to maintaining the US' reputation and leadership it established during and following World War II." Given the US' narrow-mindedness, other Asia-Pacific economies have been more willing to accept regional cooperation without the US, especially when it comes to preventing economic recession amid the global pandemic, Song Guoyou, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Thursday.

That will depend on whether US policies are aligned with common interest in Asia and adhere to multilateralism," He said. "Still, the US priority initially for the new administration will be definitely Europe, not Asia."
