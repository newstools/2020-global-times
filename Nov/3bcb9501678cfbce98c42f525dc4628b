He added that this should be seen as an incentive to continue to promote and strengthen bilateral cooperation in the field of culture and heritage between the two countries. In order to allow more people to understand the main content of this classic and its significance in cultural exchanges between China and France, the National Library of China is also holding special exhibitions to display printed editions of The Analects of Confucius in Japan and North Korea, as well as French, Italian, German and English translations of the work published from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The exhibition will be open to the public free of charge until December 6.
