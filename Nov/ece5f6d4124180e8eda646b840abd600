Legislative Council (LegCo) building of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. (Xinhua)After four opposition lawmakers were disqualified from the legislature in Hong Kong on Wednesday, which was in line with the latest legal opinion given by China’s top legislature, the remaining 15 opposition members of LegCo announced they were resigning en masse at a press conference. Such a political maneuver, as some observers said, won’t affect LegCo operations.The mass resignation was announced after the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee formulated a set of arrangements, including the standards for disqualifying Hong Kong LegCo lawmakers. The lawmakers are protesting the disqualification of opposition lawmakers Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung Kai-cheong, who have notorious records for creating trouble at LegCo and were also disqualified by the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) in July for failing to meet the requirements of the elections. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government disqualified four opposition LegCo members based on the top legislature’s decision on Hong Kong lawmakers’ qualifications to hold office.Prior to the mass resignation, Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said at a press conference on Wednesday that the mass resignation won’t affect the operations of LegCo, as the number of LegCo members meets the criteria. She also denied that the legislature would become a “rubber stamp.” The opposition apparently overestimated the power of a mass resignation. The minimum number – known as “quorum” – of LegCo members shall be not less than one half of all its members. Hong Kong LegCo, despite the mass resignation of opposition lawmakers, can still operate, as most bills only need the approval of half of the total number of lawmakers, Tian Feilong, a Hong Kong affairs expert at Beihang University in Beijing, told the Global Times.After these troublemaking opposition lawmakers leave LegCo, the legislature will be able to fully cooperate with the HKSAR government, advancing social, livelihood and economic policies at full speed, Lau Siu-kai, former policy adviser to the central government on Hong Kong policies and vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times. “The top authority is also prepared for these so-called ’mass resignations’ scenario” Lau said. The mass resignation is a commonly used tactic to show their “political posture,” in hopes of generating sympathy for the next election and winning the support of Western forces, Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong affairs at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Chinese mainland analysts said the act of “resigning en masse” proves that these opposition lawmakers have abandoned their supervisory role, and refuse to play a constructive opposition party in LegCo, but decided to go against the “one country two systems” and provoke the top legislature of the country.In response to opposition lawmakers’ threat to carry out a group resignation, Wang Wenbin, Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at Wednesday’s routine press conference that Hong Kong is China’s special administrative region and the issues on Hong Kong lawmakers’ qualifications are China’s domestic affairs. Other countries have no right to point fingers or interfere with it.Li said the Western media don’t understand how supervision works in Hong Kong, or pretend to be blind on what the opposition did in the past to interrupt the operations of the legislature, and refused to criticize their irresponsible acts.“These opposition members are not the representative of all Hong Kong people, and have failed to fulfill their duties but only create chaos, and many of them are actually trying to undermine the system rather than construct it. So they are not supervising the government but just simply opposing everything proposed by the government and the pro-establishment camp,” Li said.Supervision is not equal to simply opposing everything, and the pro-establishment camp will also have differences with the HKSAR government and strictly play the role of supervision, he noted. “If those Western critics understand this, they won’t describe the LegCo as a ‘rubber stamp’ after the opposition members’ resignation,” he said.
