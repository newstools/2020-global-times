"For Shenzhen to be built to a business hub that can attract the world's leading companies, it is crucial to have a comprehensive legal framework."Other areas of business environment improvement, including the protection of intellectual property rights, are included in the advice, as are laws and regulations on environment protection.In the area of finance, the Supreme People's Court said that it will work with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on registration-based IPO system reform, and will crack down on any illegal conduct that covers up financial risks or try to prevent financial regulation "in the name of innovation", the court said.China announced last month that it will run comprehensive pilot reforms in Shenzhen to build the city to a pilot demonstration zone for socialism with Chinese characteristics within the coming five years before 2025.Under the plan, several major reform measures have been announced so far in 2020, covering areas such as legal, business, financial and social issues, as well as the medical sector. In 2022, important progress is expected to be made in all aspects of system construction, and by 2025, reforms in key areas would have achieved landmark results.Global Times
