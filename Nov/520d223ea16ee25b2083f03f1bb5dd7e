"I would like to remind everyone that over the years Russia has called on the international community to consolidate its efforts in combating this common evil," Zakharova said during her weekly news briefing. Her statement came after some European countries remain on high alert in the wake of recent deadly attacks in France and Austria. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin also denounced acts of terror and reaffirmed Russia's readiness to enhance international cooperation against all forms and manifestations of terrorism. At least four people were killed and 15 seriously injured in multiple shootings in the Austrian capital on Monday evening, according to local police.
