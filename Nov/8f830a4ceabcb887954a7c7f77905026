China successfully sent Yaogan-30 07 group satellites into planned orbit on October 26 midnight. The satellites will mainly be used for electromagnetic environment detection and related technological tests.

The high precision satellite data obtained by the satellite center is insufficient, so it is impossible to obtain a large number of regular high-resolution satellite remote sensing data in China, Sun Weiping, an engineer at the center, told the Global Times.In the face of active discovery and timely discovery of ecological and environmental problems, the automation and accurate screening capability of high-resolution satellite remote sensing data with low cloud cover has not yet been formed, and the automation of data production is not high, Sun noted.The satellite center is actively seeking solutions to expand satellite data sources and solve the problem of insufficient satellite resources.The center told the Global Times that it will make innovations in mechanisms, collaborate with superior research and development institutions to make breakthroughs in key technologies, establish a remote sensing monitoring network for the ecological environment, deepen the application of remote sensing monitoring, and solve the problems of weak key technologies.
