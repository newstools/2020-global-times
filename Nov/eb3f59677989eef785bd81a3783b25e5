One group demonstrated peacefully for hours, advocating for racial justice."A second group of self-styled anarchist protesters, some armed, also marched downtown last night, with no discernible goal other than to cause violence and vandalism," Brown said.According to Brown, the protesters shattered the windows of a church and many other business storefronts."Indiscriminate destruction solves nothing. These are acts of privilege," Brown noted."For weeks, Oregonians have called for an end to the violence. I will continue to do everything in my power to keep the peace in Portland and make sure that people can make their voices heard safely," she added.Brown on Wednesday extended her executive order to create a joint incident command structure for public safety to keep peace and protect free speech in Portland as the country continues to wait for national election results.
