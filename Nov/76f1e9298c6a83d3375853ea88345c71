However, there might still be a few remaining viruses in their blood, which is why blood donations from people still in the recovery phase should be dealt with great caution. The latest protocol requires medics to clearly understand the health condition, travel history and likely contact with infected persons before accepting a donor's blood.Blood donors with a recent history of living abroad or in high-risk areas are also banned, as are donors who had taken influenza or novel coronavirus vaccine. The guideline aims to prevent the spread of the coronavirus during the winter, to protect staff and donors at donation sites and ensure the supply of blood. Donors who learn they have contracted the coronavirus after giving blood need to timely report to the blood collection station so that it can make detailed records for virus tracking.
