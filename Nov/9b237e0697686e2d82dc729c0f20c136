Japan's economy exited recession in the third quarter, growing a better-than-expected 5 percent, government data showed Monday, following a record contraction.

But Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga last week issued a warning over a recent rise in infections, though he said the government's campaign to promote domestic tourism would not be halted for now.
