Meanwhile, it can be seen that the central bank's intervention has also been greatly reduced, and the exchange rate is more determined by the supply and demand of foreign exchange, experts said.Meanwhile, the US has accused China of being a manipulator of the currency exchange rate many times, and its motive is to pressure China to make concessions in other aspects, which can be about trade talks, Tan said.The US conflation of countervailing duties and exchange rates is meaningless, since the US allegation about the subsidies for non-market behavior of Chinese companies is groundless, Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute, told the Global Times."In terms of exchange rate, the fluctuation of the yuan is based on the market supply and demand, which is often subject to the state of the economy," said Bai, noting that when the economy is slowing, China needs more rapid monetary easing like the US does on dollars.Bai said that the Trump administration is on its way out, so it is making all the remaining noises before stepping down. However, if the Trump administration continues its groundless moves on Chinese currency, countermeasures can be expected, noted Bai.Newspaper headline: China urges the US to stop its groundless allegation about so-called undervaluation of Chinese yuan Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
