Non-essential shops, hairdressers, and leisure and entertainment venues will also be shut.Meanwhile, different households will be banned from mixing, although support bubbles and childcare bubbles will remain. Gyms will be shut but people can continue to exercise outdoors, at most with one person from another household.Schools, colleges and universities will remain open and those who cannot work from home, such as construction or manufacturing workers, will be encouraged to continue going to their workplaces.To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Russia and the United States are racing against time to develop coronavirus vaccines.
