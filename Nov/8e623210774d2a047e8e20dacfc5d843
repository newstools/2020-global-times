Italy's lower house of parliament on Wednesday passed an antidiscrimination bill that makes violence against women and LGBT+ people a hate crime, with those found guilty of such attacks risking longer prison terms.

World Food Day was marked across Italy with both colorful and serious events plus tributes to the Rome-based United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which marked the 75th founding anniversary the same day.

The conservative campaign group Pro Life and Family has said the bill will make LGBT+ people "more equal than others," while Italian bishops warned in June 2019 that the new law could curb dissenting opinions, including that a family requires the union of a man and a woman.Zan has denied that the bill would impinge on free speech.Newspaper headline: Italyâ€™s lower house okays bill for LGBT+
