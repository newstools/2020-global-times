Nearly half of these deaths occurred in the Midwest, according to the tracking project.While the Midwest remains the epicenter of long-term care facility outbreaks, accounting for 39 percent of new cases, the crisis stretches beyond the Midwest.As COVID-19 continued to sweep the country, each region reported their largest increase of long-term care cases in the past four months, according to the tracking project."With winter approaching and case numbers higher than ever before, existing safety measures will not adequately protect this vulnerable population," said a report of the project.Public health officials have urged Americans to celebrate Thanksgiving only with members of the same household, or at least gather outdoors, to avoid further virus spread.The CDC issued a new guidance last Friday urging Americans to stay home and not travel for Thanksgiving."Travel may increase your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others this year," said the guidance.The United States has recorded more than 12.86 million cases with over 263,200 related deaths as of Thursday afternoon, according to the real-time count kept by Johns Hopkins University.
