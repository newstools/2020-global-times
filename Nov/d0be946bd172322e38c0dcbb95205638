Sarkozy's phone was registered to a Paul Bismuth.Prosecutors have said the wiretaps revealed that Sarkozy and Herzog had on multiple occasions discussed contacting Azibert, a magistrate at the Cour de Cassation, France's top appeals court for criminal cases, and well-informed on the Bettencourt inquiry. They allege that Sarkozy offered to help Azibert get the Monaco job in return for insider help."Mr Azibert never got the job in Monaco," Sarkozy told BFM TV in November. Sarkozy and his center-right party Les Republicains have for years said the investigations against the former president are politically motivated.Newspaper headline: An heiress, a judge and a job: Sarkozy goes on trial for corruption
