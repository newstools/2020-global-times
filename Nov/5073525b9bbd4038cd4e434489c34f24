Land inequality is growing worldwide, threatening the livelihoods of 2.5 billion people who directly rely on farming and widening disparities in gender, health and climate-change impacts, researchers warned on Tuesday.

In the longer term, it is detrimental to human development, socio-political stability, and environmental sustainability."The study, which measured land inequality using traditional census data, as well as tenure, quality of land and other indicators in 17 countries, found that concentration of land has increased in nearly all regions worldwide since 1980.The largest 1 percent of farms operate more than 70 percent of the world's farmland, according to the study of countries. Meanwhile, the wealthiest 10 percent of rural populations control 60 percent of the value of agricultural land, while the poorest half only have 3 percent. Latin America is the most unequal region, according to the data that did not include corporate ownership."Growing inequality is the greatest obstacle to poverty eradication - in countries like Guatemala, extreme inequality costs lives," Ana Maria Mendez, Oxfam's Guatemala director, said in a statement."As we confront the coronavirus pandemic and catastrophic hurricanes fueled by climate change, the impact of land inequality is even more stark," she added.Increasing pressure on land from industry, agriculture and infrastructure projects has led to violent conflicts, with at least 212 people killed in 2019 while defending their land, according to advocacy group Global Witness. Rapid urbanization and changes in agricultural practices such as increased commercial monocropping have also been linked to the spread of disease, including the novel coronavirus.The lack of regulatory instruments to check land concentration will continue to drive inequality in the future, Anseeuw said.Newspaper headline: Urbanization linked to disease
