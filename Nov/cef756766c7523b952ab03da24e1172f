While China carries out its own virus source tracing, it is also taking the lead to invite experts from the WHO to visit the country to work together on the issue, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a press briefing. Zhao said China has also held online video seminars with experts from the WHO, adding that tracing the virus source is a scientific question that should be carried out by scientists through international research and cooperation across the globe. It will help us better understand animal reservoirs and the route of transmission to humans, prevent potential risks in the future and protect the health and safety of people in countries around the world. As the mission of tracing the virus source is being carried out, it may involve many countries and regions, Zhao said, noting that "we hope all related countries will adopt a positive attitude and launch cooperation with the WHO, just as China is doing."
