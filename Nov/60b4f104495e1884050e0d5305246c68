(Xinhua/Wang Shen)The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) have set up hotlines for the public to provide information on national security issues through social media platforms, and promised not to request or disclose any information to third parties through the hotline. "To facilitate the provision of information and reports on national security, the National Security Department of the HKPF is officially launching the 'National Security Department Reporting Hotline' today, which allows members of the public to make non-emergency reports on national security through multiple platforms including WeChat, SMS or email," the HKPF wrote on Facebook on Thursday. The hotline will only receive information, including photographs, audio or video recordings, related to national security issues, the HKPF stated. The HKPF stressed that the police will not request personal information from the informants through this hotline. None of the information collected will be disclosed to third parties and will be handled in strict accordance with the personal data ordinance.About half an hour after the hotlines were announced, the WeChat account could no longer be added as a contact, due to "too many friend applications at this time."The national security law for Hong Kong came into effect on July 1, and is designed to help effectively punish crimes endangering national security and restore stability in Hong Kong. Global Times
