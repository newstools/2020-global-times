After negotiations, the Canadian and Chinese sides agreed to bring back the black-and-white stars to China ahead of schedule.The Chengdu base on Sunday thanked Canada for its support in China's giant panda protection and called on both countries to continue exchanges and cooperation on the protection of endangered species.The two pandas arrived in Canada in 2013 as part of a 10-year agreement between Canada and China over the animal's protection and research.After spending five years at the Toronto Zoo, the duo moved to the Calgary Zoo in March 2018 with twin cubs, "Jia Panpan" and "Jia Yueyue," which had traveled home to China in January.
