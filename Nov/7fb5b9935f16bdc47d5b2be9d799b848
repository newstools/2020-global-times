If the packages in question are not for emergency use, people should open them one or two days later, after leaving them exposed outdoors.At least eight new confirmed local COVID-19 cases all related to cargo operations in Shanghai Pudong International Airport during the past two weeks were reported, making freight coming into the city and its COVID-19 prevention measures the main focus for the public, as Shanghai plays an important role in international freight transportation.Unlike imported cold-chain goods that have been thought to be possibly contaminated by the coronavirus, the local cases reported on November 9-10 were porters who hadn't been in contact with any COVID-19 cases or cold-chain goods 14 days before they showed any symptoms. Pudong airport also tested all its staffs overnight on Sunday to screen for any possible cases.
