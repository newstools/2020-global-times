 According to a report by job-hunting platform Zhilian Zhaopin released last month, recruitment demand in the entertainment, sports and leisure industries increased as much as 406.26 percent year-on-year, driven by the fast-growing livestreaming industry.Demand for labor in the transportation and logistics industry rose in a linear fashion, pushed up by e-commerce shopping festivals.According to the BOSS Direct Employment Research Institute, the average monthly salary in the third quarter in the transportation and logistics industry rose 8.1 percent quarter-on-quarter to 8,439 yuan ($1,285). Demand for supply chain and logistics positions increased by 58.1 percent.According to the NBS, the surveyed unemployment rate among those aged 25-59 was 4.8 percent in October, the same as in September.
