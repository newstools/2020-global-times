We hope to maintain a communication channel between tourism industries across the Strait and explore cooperation potential together with our Taiwan counterparts," Man said.People in Taiwan's tourism industry were looking forward to the event, said Lai Seh-jen, chairperson of Taiwan Tourism Interchange Association in Taipei, adding that 360 tickets to attend the event in Taiwan were booked within two days after the online registration started."We have learned that mutual assistance and cooperation are the best way to cope with the challenges brought by the epidemic," Lai said. "We hope the event will build a platform between tourism industries across the Strait and better prepare us for seizing business opportunities when the epidemic ends."At Monday's online meeting, tourism officials from Beijing, Hebei and Heilongjiang briefed participants in Taipei and Kaohsiung about tourism projects related to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and tourist attractions in winter.On Tuesday, the other two online meetings will introduce tourist attractions along the Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road.
