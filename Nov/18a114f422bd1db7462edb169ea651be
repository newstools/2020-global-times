(Xinhua/Sun Yin)Â Namibia has lost 23 rhinos and two elephants to poaching since the beginning of the year, the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism said Thursday. Ministry spokesperson Romeo Muyunda said the country is winning the fight against poaching. "We are happy with the drop in poaching cases, it brings us closer to our overall objective of reducing poaching to zero. We are happy that our interventions are working and that the collaboration we have established with various stakeholders is bearing fruits," Muyunda said. "The challenge will be now to maintain the current momentum at the same time implementing strategies to stop poaching completely." Namibia recorded 57 poaching cases in 2019, which comprised 46 rhinos and 13 elephants. Muyunda said this year's cases were mostly recorded in Etosha National Park, private farms and rhino custodian areas.
