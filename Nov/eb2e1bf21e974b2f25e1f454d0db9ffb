Similar concerns have also been raised to reporters from Russia.On August 17, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a routine press briefing that Chinese journalists have long submitted their visa extension applications to the US government, but no one has received any reply.The US has been escalating its suppression of Chinese media out of its Cold War mentality and ideological bias. On October 26, China demanded that China-based branches of six US media in the country declare in written form the information about their staff, finances, operations and real estate in China within seven days in a reciprocal measure against the US decision to designate six more Chinese media as "foreign missions."Analysts also suggested that China could impose visa restrictions on American journalists in Hong Kong as a countermeasure to US suppression.
