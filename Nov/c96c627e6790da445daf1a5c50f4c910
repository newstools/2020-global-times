Both are being isolated and treated at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.Sun Xiaodong, deputy director of the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference on Monday that the confirmed local cases reported on November 9 and 10 had both been exposed to one contaminated air cargo container.These sporadic cases related to imported cargos show that COVID-19 continues to attempt to enter China's borders, and China will face severe challenges domestically in winter, Wu said, noting that he is confident China will pass the winter test.Global Times
