It will also provide a multilateral platform for member states to mediate their long-standing disputes and de-escalate border tensions. The SCO will fight the "three evils" of terrorism, separatism and religious extremism under the pandemic to further reinforce regional peace, as well as prevent foreign intervention that tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the member states, said experts.China cannot be separated from the world in achieving development, and the world also needs China for prosperity. Now, China is speeding up efforts to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other, Xi remarked.Leaders of the SCO members, including China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and India, have exchanged views at the meeting in order to further strengthen cooperation within the SCO framework in the context of the pandemic and major international and regional issues. Thanks to the unilateralism and protectionism pushed by the Trump administration in the past four years, the development of the SCO cooperation has experienced a golden era, as under the joint guidance of China and Russia, the organization is getting increasingly united; and in the post-Trump era, the SCO will be even more united, said Chinese experts.

So now they are very cautious rather than cheering Biden's victory too soon with the Western liberal world," Yang said.The China-Russia strategic partnership is getting more and more mature as the two countries have formed a highly consistent and tacit strategic mentality, and this solid partnership has not been weakened even a little bit due to the power transition within the US, said Chinese analysts.  China and Russia have very clear, calm and cautious understanding of the "new world" that Western countries are expecting under the leadership of a new US government led by the Democrats.New roles, new tasksIt is important that we forestall terrorist, separatist and extremist attempts to exploit the pandemic for disruption, curb the proliferation of drugs, crack down on internet-based propagation of extremist ideology, and deepen SCO members' law-enforcement cooperation, Xi noted.Yang said that due to the pandemic, many countries' economic development and people's livelihoods in the region have been seriously impacted and this has provided chances for local terrorist groups to recruit more people, which is a new problem for the SCO."To fight these forces, military and intelligence cooperation is not enough. Economic cooperation to boost development can effectively wipe out the soil where terrorism and extremism are able to grow," Yang said.Xi announced at the online meeting that next year, China will host a China-SCO forum on the digital economy industry in Chongqing, which will provide a platform for innovation cooperation among parties.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that "China's advantages in the digital economy has helped it realize many new forms of economic activities amid the epidemic situation. But not every SCO member has such capabilities, so in order to benefit the whole region, intergovernmental and inter-enterprise cooperation are essential."More importantly, the digital economy is a new sector with vague rules, and in the past the US-led Western world made the rules. But this time, China needs to use the platform of the SCO to reinforce its influence on rule making over the digital economy, Li said.Putin has voiced Russia's support for Xi's statement concerning the safety of digital data. "In this regard, we will support China's initiative, as well as the idea to hold a digital economy forum in China," Putin said, expressing hope that other SCO member states would be willing to participate in the event next year, TASS reported.Platform for conflict mediationIn 2020, India has border tensions and even direct conflicts with other SCO members including China and Pakistan, and some Western media and observers consider that the SCO is heading to a divided future. But Chinese analysts said that in fact, the SCO is playing a new role for member states to solve their disputes and de-escalate tensions."When the SCO decided to include India and Pakistan, conflicts between the member states from time to time will not be a surprise, so the organization has prepared for such cases," Yang said.Border disputes between some SCO members are long-standing problems which existed long before they become SCO members, so the SCO is actually providing a platform for them to communicate and engage in dialogues, Yang said. "The participation of China, Pakistan and India in the meeting is proof that the problems between them didn't impact the normal operation of the SCO," Yang noted.
