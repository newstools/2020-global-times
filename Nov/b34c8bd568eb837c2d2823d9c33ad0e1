Zhao Huirong, a research fellow of Central Asian studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes that the US strategy in the region is likely to show a contraction trend, which will give more room to the SCO members to be independent in policymaking.Members of the SCO have supported each other in pursuing development paths suited to their own national conditions and taking measures to safeguard national security, oppose external forces' interference in the internal affairs of member states, and resolve differences through dialogue and consultations, Le said. The SCO was established in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India and Pakistan joined as full members in 2017. In addition, Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran and Mongolia have observer status, while six countries, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Turkey, are dialogue partners.  Newspaper headline: SCO meeting to highlight multilaterlism
