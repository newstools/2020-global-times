China's newly-developed exoskeleton equipment.

That is why traditional manual work is still necessary.But in high-altitude regions, due to the lack of oxygen, goods that weigh 1 kilogram feel like 5 kilograms, and at an elevation of 3,500 meters, a human being's physical capabilities decay to only 70-75 percent of normal level, Zhang said.The exoskeleton can effectively save 5-10 percent of the energy expended in walking, climbing and carrying goods, and about 70- 80 percent of the energy used in standing, when carrying a load of 25 kilograms, according to Zhang.Thanks to the usage of carbon fiber materials, the exoskeleton weighs only about 4 kilograms, and it is very durable despite possible rough usages in high-altitude, mountainous regions, the developer said, noting that to counter the extreme cold and wear-and-tear issues, the equipment does not contain any plastic.Hand-on experience by Global Times reporters on Tuesday found that putting on the superlight carbon fiber-composed gear takes less than a minute and it's easy to use it in walking, leaping and running.To better understand the energy-saving function of the gear, Global Times reporters put on a 25-kilogram backpack for testing, and it worked wonders. One can easily carry such a weight in a rather relaxed fashion and manage to move up and down without developing pain or soreness in the back or shoulders.Without the gear, the 25-kilogram backpack was quite hard to carry, let alone tread on complex terrains.Global Times reporters found that taking off the gear would take around 10 seconds.Zhang said that it took only about 20 days to build the first batch of dozens of exoskeletons, which are currently priced at less than 50,000 yuan ($7,565) each. Based on customer demand, production can be accelerated to 1,000 units a month, and the unit price can be reduced.Newspaper headline: Exoskeletons head for high-altitude use
