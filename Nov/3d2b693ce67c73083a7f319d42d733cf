Islamic State (IS) militants attend a surrender ceremony in Jalalabad city, capital of Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, Nov. 17, 2019. More than 600 Islamic State (IS) fighters and their families including women and children have surrendered to security forces in Achin district of eastern Afghanistan's Nangarhar province over the past two weeks amid increasing military operations, an army commander in the restive district General Mohammad Karim Niazi said.

After a fierce three-year fight backed by the US-led coalition, Iraq declared IS defeated in late 2017.The coalition has significantly drawn down its troops in 2020, consolidating them to three main bases in Baghdad, Ain al-Asad in the west and Arbil in the north. But IS' sleeper cells have continued to wage hit-and-run attacks on security forces and state infrastructure, particularly in desert areas where troops are stretched thin.Attacks with such high tolls and so close to the capital have been rare, however.AFP
