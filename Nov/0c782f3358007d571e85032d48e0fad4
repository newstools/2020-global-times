After returning to China, she has incorporated the experience and inspiration found overseas into her work, while also traveling to the provinces of Qinghai and Yunnan to help local craftsmen. Most of the more than 70 works at the exhibition, which comes to an end on December 12, were created during her time in France or shortly after her return.
