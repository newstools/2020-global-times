We want our future cooperation to be open but fair in all areas," he tweeted early Monday.The European Commission chief spokesperson Eric Mamer reiterated that the "quality" of the agreement is prioritized over "any kind of timing or deadline."A video summit of EU leaders, slated for Nov. 19 to discuss the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic, is now viewed in Brussels as the final deadline for a draft Brexit deal, according to The Guardian newspaper.
