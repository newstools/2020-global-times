The proposals include quadrupling offshore wind power within a decade while scaling up hydrogen production capacity for industry, transport, power and homes.Investment will also be made in zero-emission public transport, alongside research into zero-emission planes and ships, and in making cycling and walking "more attractive."The plans contain broader aims to make Britain a "world-leader" in carbon capture technology and the city of London a "global center of green finance."The government will also spend 525 million pounds on developing large and smaller-scale nuclear plants, and new advanced modular reactors, in a move likely to anger environmentalists.Johnson is hoping the ambitious proposals can help deliver on pledges to reduce Britain's stark regional inequality and repair some of the economic damage done by the pandemic.They are also being seen as an opportunity to reset his faltering government and align with the priorities of US President-elect Joe Biden, ahead of the UK hosting global climate talks in December."My 10-point plan will create, support and protect hundreds of thousands of green jobs, whilst making strides towards net zero by 2050," Johnson said in a statement ahead of publishing the full blueprint."Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the North East, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales."The 2030 ban on petrol and diesel cars and vans follows what Downing Street called "extensive consultation with car manufacturers and sellers."Johnson had said in February his government would aim to end such sales by 2035, but will now only allow the sale of hybrid vehicles until that year.Under the new plans, it will invest 1.3 billion pounds on expanding electric vehicle chargepoints in homes and streets across England, and make 582 million pounds available in grants for people to buy zero or ultra-low emission vehicles.
