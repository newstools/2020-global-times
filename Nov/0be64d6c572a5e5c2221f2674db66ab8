Huawei. Photo: VCGChina is highly concerned about the reported Romania Huawei 5G ban, and hopes Romania to "independently make objective and fair decisions," and provide an open and fair business environment for foreign companies, including Chinese firms, said a spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Romania.Where a country is going with regard to its 5G policy reflects whether the country can guarantee the safety of foreign investment, and whether it can create an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment, which is an important indicator of a country's investment environment and global image, noted the spokesperson.It is hoped that the relevant parties in Romania will adhere to the principles of market economy and fair competition, abide by international economic and trade rules, use facts and science as the criteria [when making the decision], said the spokesperson.The remarks come after Romanian Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said Huawei "does not meet [security] conditions" to be part of 5G networks in the country. "With respect to 5G, [China] cannot be our partner," Orban told media in an interview published on November 1."We'll choose a company that poses no threat to national security or other areas," he said.Chinese high-tech companies such as Huawei have actively participated in the construction of Romania's information infrastructure for many years, and have made positive contributions to promoting local economic and social development and technological progress. There has not been a single cyber security incident and no threat to national security, according to the spokesperson.Â "We resolutely oppose the abuse of the concept of 'national security' to violate market laws and the principle of fair competition, exclude specific companies in specific countries, and block scientific and technological cooperation without factual basis and conclusive evidence," said the spokesperson.Romania's move also comes as US has repeatedly pressed its allies to block Huawei from building their 5G networks, citing so-called national securities risks, but has failed to provide any solid evidence so far.Cybersecurity is a common concern of all countries. China is willing to work with all countries to support the development of 5G network security standards and rules through a transparent and inclusive multilateral process under a universally representative and authoritative international mechanism and framework based on the concept of open and cooperative cybersecurity, the spokesperson further said.China will be more than willing to jointly promote global data security cooperation, so that safe, reliable, and high-quality information technology can provide new impetus for the global economic recovery and the better life for people in all countries, according to the spokesperson.
