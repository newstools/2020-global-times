And such characterizations of his game continued in his life.The legendary life of Maradona transcends the sport of football itself, earning him the status of an Argentine national icon and a worldwide idol, yet his personal lifestyle has been a matter of controversy, observers said.Maradona's heyday came in before the advent of the information age, and enlightened Chinese fans of earlier generations what the best player was like, Wang Dazhao, a Beijing-based sports commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday.The angel side of Maradona with heavenly skills and talents taught the kids around the world about the glories, joys and strengths of the football game, while his darker devil side that was underscored by almost self-destructive lifestyle off the pitch triggered deep thoughts, sports commentators said.He became addicted to cocaine and was repeatedly banned from club and international football for failing drug tests, including testing positive for doping at the 1994 World Cup in the US. In 2004, Maradona spent time in intensive care after a heart attack, and his weight fluctuated during his battles with alcohol and drug addiction.If being a great player and a decent man at the same time is the most demanding task, Maradona accomplished half of it with almost perfection in his lifetime but left the other half unfinished, Wang said.Newspaper headline: Tributes pour in for Maradona after death
