The most affected country has been Guatemala, where about 150 people are missing. Rescuers on Saturday searched for the bodies of residents of an indigenous village in the north of the country that was hit by a landslide.In Honduras, heavy flooding in the north and northwest of the country killed 23 people, according to authorities.
