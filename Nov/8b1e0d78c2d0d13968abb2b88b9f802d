They should also swear allegiance to the HKSAR and China.The four are also among 12 candidates who were disqualified for failing to meet the requirements of the LegCo elections, which should have been held in September, but were postponed for a year due to the COVID-19 outbreak, said the office, noting that as they have already been disqualified as lawmakers based on the top legislature's decision, they are no longer allowed to perform their duties at the sixth LegCo. Echoing the liaison office's remarks, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said that the NPC Standing Committee's decision has provided a solid legal basis for regulating and dealing with matters concerning the qualification of LegCo members, and its decision has unchallengeable legal authority. The NPC Standing Committee's decision helps ensure the smooth operation of the sixth LegCo, and creates positive conditions to boost the HKSAR's economy, people's lives, and solve underlying problems in Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.The decision is in line with "one country, two systems," and has profound meaning in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development; as well as Hong Kong's social stability and development, said the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
