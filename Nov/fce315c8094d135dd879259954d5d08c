China launches Chang'e-5 mission via Long March-5 rocket to retrieve Moon rocks at Wenchang Space Launch Center from South China's Hainan Province early Tuesday morning.

The spacecraft has successfully descended into a lower near-circular lunar orbit, the Global Times learned from the China National Space Administration (CNSA).The CNSA said in a statement it sent to the Global Times on Sunday evening that the spacecraft carried out the second braking operation around 8:25 pm on Sunday, when it traveled to the perilune, the closest point of a lunar orbit, which has brought it to a new lower near-circular  orbit from the previous elliptical orbit.The braking maneuver is one of the key orbital control measures for any lunar probe mission. It is designed to slow the probe and to ensure it can be captured by the lunar gravitational field.

The return capsule will separate from the orbital module and return to its designated landing site in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.The Chang'e-5 probe was launched by a Long March-5 Y5 carrier rocket from Wenchang Space Launch Center in South China's Hainan Province early on Tuesday. The entire mission will last around 23 days, according to the CNSA.
