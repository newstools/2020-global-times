Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was grilled by opposition lawmakers on Wednesday over whether he made inaccurate claims in parliament in 2019 about a potential breach of laws on gift-giving by his predecessor.

The rule is so strict that one cabinet minister quit in 2014 after distributing paper fans during the summer.Suga has been linked to the scandal, which dogged Abe in the final year of his tenure, as he was the then-prime minister's right-hand man during his 2012-20 term. He told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that he had "always checked in advance with former Prime Minister Abe" on his responses about the matter, deflecting the blame for any potentially inaccurate statements."I will refrain from commenting further, as it involves the activities of an investigative force," he added, when pressed further about inconsistent statements in parliament.Abe vehemently denied his office had subsidized parties during parliamentary sessions last year where he was grilled by opposition lawmakers.On Tuesday, Abe said he was aware of the accusations and promised that his office will "fully cooperate" with Tokyo prosecutors who are looking into the matter, but declined to comment further.Opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan leader Yukio Edano said on Tuesday the media revelations meant Abe had lied in parliament when he denied his office subsidized parties."Prime Minister Suga was also the ringleader of the Abe administration in his position as chief cabinet secretary, and he can't escape that responsibility," Edano said.Japanese media said Abe's office helped cover a shortfall of about 8 million yen ($76,540) over the last five years of his premiership.
