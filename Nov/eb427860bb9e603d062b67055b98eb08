Tencent was up by 6.2 percent, NetEase gained 7.26 percent, Alibaba rose by 6.28 percent and BYD surged by more than 16 percent.Market analysts said the rally in the domestic market was also due to China's commitment to opening-up and becoming a greater market benefiting its economic partners.The trend was in line with the momentum in the US stock market on Wednesday, when US stocks closed sharply higher after Democrat Joe Biden gained swing-state votes.
