In 2022, important progress is expected to be made in all aspects of system construction, and by 2025, the reforms in key areas would have achieved landmark results.Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
