(Xinhua/Wang Ying)The United States has recorded more than 9,079,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 230,000 deaths as of Saturday afternoon, according to the real-time count kept by Johns Hopkins University.It took only 14 days for the country to add one million new cases from 8 million to 9 million, the fastest rate since the pandemic began.Confirmed cases and deaths have skyrocketed across the United States in recent days. The surge in cases was not driven by an increasing number of tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project, because the cases increase rate far outpaced the test growth.The country reported a record number of tests at 8.2 million, but the case growth was 24 percent, compared with test growth of 9 percent.Total COVID-19 hospitalized patients reached 46,688 on Friday, according to the tracking project. It rose 63.2 percent from a three-month low of 28,608 on Sept. 20, and was the highest total since Aug. 13.Fourteen states and one US territory reported record high hospitalizations Friday, according to the tracking project.
