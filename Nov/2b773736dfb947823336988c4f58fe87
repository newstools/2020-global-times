No longer will he be 'the world's loneliest elephant,'" deputy environment minister Neth Pheaktra said."We expect to breed Kaavan with local elephants - this is an effort to conserve the genetic fold," the minister told AFP.Before he was transported to the sanctuary, monks offered him bananas and watermelon, chanting prayers and sprinkling holy water on his crate to bless him.AFP
