These are children." Venezuela opposition leader David Smolansky, tasked by the Organization of American States with monitoring migrants from his country, said the group of 29 deported migrants included 16 minors, one of them a baby of just four months.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights expressed its concern and called on Trinidad and Tobago to guarantee entry for Venezuelans seeking protection for humanitarian reasons.After hours of uncertainty, opposition deputy Omar Gonzalez said the deportees were found in the Amacuro delta, a remote region in western Venezuela. He said the children would return to the island at the request of a Trinidadian judge.
