Braun and the pop star have been involved in a bitter public dispute ever since.Swift, a 10-time Grammy winner, wrote on Monday that she received a letter a few weeks ago from private equity company Shamrock Holdings "letting us know that they had brought 100 percent of my music, videos and album art from Scooter Braun."She added that under the terms of the sale, Braun "will continue to profit off my old music catalog for many years."Braun did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hollywood trade outlet Variety reported on Monday that Braun had sold the master rights to Swift's first six albums to an investment fund in a deal believed to be worth more than $300 million.
