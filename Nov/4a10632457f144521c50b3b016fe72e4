(Xinhua/REUTERS)Australian wine producer Treasury Wine saw its shares drop another 12 percent on Monday, after China imposed temporary anti-dumping measures last Friday.The company's share had already plunged 11 percent on Friday, when a preliminary ruling by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) imposed provisional anti-dumping measures in the form of deposits on wine imported from Australia, with the deposits ranging from 107.1 to 212.1 percent.The anti-dumping tariffs, at 169 percent, took effect on Saturday and are expected to remain in effect until August, 2021.Under the weight of the anti-dumping duties, Treasury Wine made an announcement on Monday to divest Penfolds, one of its best-known labels, as part of an emergency plan to seek new markets after China's anti-dumping duties. Treasury Wine's stock price has dropped a staggering 43 percent so far this year, under the negative influence of a souring relationship between China and Australia. China is Australia's number one wine export market by value. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, China imported AU$3 billion ($2.2 billion) worth of Australian wine in the first three quarters of the year, up 4 percent year-on-year, Australia's public broadcaster ABC reported, citing industry reports.As of June 30, Australian wine exports to China increased 0.7 percent year-on-year, and accounted for 37 percent of total wine imports in China, far exceeding the imports of other major wine producers such as France, Chile and Italy. Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
