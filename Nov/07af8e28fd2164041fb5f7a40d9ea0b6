Photo: ICOnline retailers in China set new sales records with the launch of this year's Double 11 or Singles' Day shopping festival, as China's economy fully displays its resilience and vast capacity after achieving a strong recovery from the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 epidemic earlier in 2020.Major e-commerce platforms received a record number of frantic orders from consumers, within minutes after the shopping spree kicked off on Sunday.As the biggest shopping festival after the country largely controlled the coronavirus, Alibaba — owner of leading e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall — launched promotions as early as Sunday, prior to the main event on November 11, with discounts on 14 million products to maximize results.As of 1:51 am on Sunday, just 111 minutes into the event, 100 brands recorded sales on Tmall of more than 100 million yuan ($14.9 million), data sent by Alibaba to the Global Times showed.In the first 60 seconds, Adidas' turnover on the Tmall platform exceeded 100 million yuan, followed closely by Nike.Cosmetics and 3C electronic products were the most sought, with brands like Apple, L'Oréal, Haier, Estee Lauder, Huawei, Midea, Lancome and Xiaomi all joining the 100 million yuan club.Data from rival e-commerce company JD.com also showed a promising start for the shopping spree. Turnover of Huawei's new Mate40 series exceeded 100 million yuan in eight seconds on JD.com. In the first 10 minutes, sales of iPhone and Xiaomi smartphones soared by more than 10 times year-on-year."I believe there will be many spotlights in this year's festival, which is like a barometer of China's economic health, reflecting the vitality of the domestic consumer market," said Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent analyst."We need such shopping extravaganzas to release pent-up demand with the nation's economic growth turning positive in the first three quarters," Liu told the Global Times on Saturday.At a time when the overseas pandemic has not been fully contained, more luxury brands are looking to Double 11 to boost their sales in China.The top 10 luxury brands debuted their new products on Tmall, offering the most generous discounts in history, according to Alibaba.Watch brand Vacheron Constantin, for example, moved the global debut of its new products forward to Double 11 from Christmas as originally planned. Vehicle maker Porsche opened a flagship store on Tmall before Double 11 to boost sales. More than 200 items from Valentino and Burberry are offering interest-free payment plans for the first time in order to lure Chinese customers.Chinese people were trapped at home for months by the virus, and now they're eager to spend money during this year's Singles' Day event.Luo Jiao, a Shanghai-based resident, told the Global Times she spent 3,000 yuan for a Burberry scarf on Tmall for her birthday."I saved 10,000 yuan from my tourism budget to spend on Single's Day, since international travel is blocked due to the pandemic. There is not much price difference between the online offer and the physical store," Luo said.The epidemic cut some people's incomes, but for mass consumer items, sales vitality is back, Zhang Yi, CEO of Guangzhou-based market research firm iiMedia Research, told the Global Times."Money that was originally saved for traveling abroad and buying luxury goods in overseas markets, for example, has been saved for domestic consumption and the Double 11 festival is an opportunity," he added.Railway shipments for Double 11 kicked off on Sunday. It is expected that the capacity of the Yangtze River Delta Railway network will increase by about 20 percent year-on-year, and volume will increase about 28 percent.
