"It's truly a joint Libyan committee."The meeting follows an October 23 deal when the two warring factions signed a "permanent" cease-fire agreement intended to pave the way toward a political solution to the country's grinding conflict.Williams said Monday that a "determination to implement the cease-fire agreement was present at the table."Libya, with Africa's largest proven crude oil reserves, has been wracked by conflict for nearly a decade, since the overthrow and killing of Moamer Kadhafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.It has since been dominated by armed groups and divided between two bitterly opposed administrations: the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) based in the capital Tripoli and a rival administration in the east backed by military commander Khalifa Haftar.The talks are part of long-running efforts to broker peace.Haftar, backed by Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, launched an offensive on Tripoli in April 2019, but was beaten back in June by the GNA with military support from Turkey.Warring factions returned to the negotiating table in September in UN-supported talks, with negotiations being held in Morocco, Egypt and Switzerland.On November 9, the political leaders are due to hold face-to-face talks in Tunisia.The UN envoy expects coming political talks to designate a date for national elections, Reuters reports.Newspaper headline: UN hails ‘progress’ as military rivals meet
