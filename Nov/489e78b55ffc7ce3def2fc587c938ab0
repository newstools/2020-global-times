We can't tell at this stage whether this will be by the end of this week, or whenever - or at all," the senior diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity."This is already getting extremely late," he told reporters. In London, a Downing Street spokesman agreed: "There is much work to be done and time is very short."With a late October deadline already blown, a deal is needed to allow time for legal vetting and translation and then ratification by the European Parliament, whose last scheduled meeting of 2020 is on December 16.The diplomat warned that "creative solutions" would be needed if a deal was delivered too late. Any accord would require two to three weeks of legal work before a vote by members of the European Parliament (MEPs)."We work very hard to get a deal, but there is still quite a lot to do," said Frost as he arrived for a session of talks with Barnier.Officials on both sides of the talks say negotiators are waiting for the opposite side to make a big move on the toughest issues that remain.For the UK, the EU must discount its hopes of keeping permanent wide access to British waters for European fishermen.The EU meanwhile is waiting for London to lay down guarantees for fair competition on matters such as the environment, health and state aid."We are very strict on our conditions [and] they are acceptable," said Thierry Breton, France's representative to the European Commission that is spearheading the talks for the EU.AFP
