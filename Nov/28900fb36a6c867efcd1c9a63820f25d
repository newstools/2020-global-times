The offers should be very welcome," Song noted. Experts also noted that China's next five-year plan, which charts the nation's development path for the coming five years and features the new development paradigm of "dual circulation," could provide opportunities for many economies in the world to recover from COVID19 crisis.Xi has also took the chance at the multilateral events to explain key issues related to this strategic decision, including the reason why China has to foster such a paradigm and what it means to the world, as well as policies and measures to open the country still wider, and China's willingness to share its development opportunities.Whatever difficulties may come its way, China will always uphold multilateralism and win-win cooperation, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters on Sunday, adding that the government will be steadfast in advancing the building of a new-type of international relations and a community with a shared future for the humanity.Newspaper headline: Experts hail Xi’s proposals
