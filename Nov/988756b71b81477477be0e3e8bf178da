A federal judge in Texas scheduled an emergency hearing for Monday on whether Houston officials unlawfully allowed drive-through voting and should toss 100,000 votes in the Democratic-leaning area.

It currently has 10 drive-through polling sites, which are available to all voters.The lawsuit came after the Texas Supreme Court, one of the most conservative state courts in the US, rejected similar bids to halt drive-through voting in Harris County.The plaintiffs ask Hanen to "reject any votes it finds were cast in violation of the Texas Election Code" and "requir[e] all memory cards from the 10 drive-through voting locations be secured and not entered or downloaded into the Tally machine until this Court issues an order on this Complaint."Hanen was appointed to the federal judiciary by then-president George W. Bush.The request is "wholly unreasonable," Democratic groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said on Friday in a motion asking to intervene in the case."Plaintiffs ask this Court to throw Texas' election into chaos by invalidating the votes of more than 100,000 eligible Texas voters who cast their ballots at drive-thru voting locations."Newspaper headline: Texas judge to hear Republican bid to void 100,000 votes
