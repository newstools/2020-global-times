But US environmentalists, who have opposed drilling in ANWR for decades and garnered support from President-elect Joe Biden, vowed to fight the effort.Leasing tracts normally takes months in between the period when a property is first publicized and a contract is finalized, posing challenges to Trump's timetable."Nobody should ever underestimate the Trump administration's willingness to ignore the law in favor of its agenda, but I don't see how they could sign leases before they are ushered out," Niel Lawrence, Alaska director at the National Resources Defense Council told AFP, adding that who environmentalists "are girding for battle."The move aims to open up to development a target area long sought by petroleum interests and defended by environmentalists. Some major banks have said they won't finance projects in the refuge. Biden said during the campaign that permanently protecting ANWR stood among his "day one" priorities.Newspaper headline: Trump office to seek bids on Arctic oil leases
