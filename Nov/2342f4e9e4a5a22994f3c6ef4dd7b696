His upcoming appearance on Australia's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here reality series was also reportedly canceled.The since-deleted post features an image of a caterpillar wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap speaking with a butterfly that has the "Black Sun" symbol on its wing.In a later video to his 1.7 million social media followers, Evans said allegations made against him were "untrue, unfactual and a load of garbage." Since the coronavirus pandemic began, Evans has routinely promoted conspiracy theories about the outbreak.He is also known for promoting pseudoscientific dieting ideas such as the palaeolithic diet, earning him the nickname "Paleo" Pete.
