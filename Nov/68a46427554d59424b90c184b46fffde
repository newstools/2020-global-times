The fourth was killed by a falling tree."The winds are fierce. We can hear the trees being pummeled. It's very strong," Francia Mae Borras, 21, told AFP from her home in the coastal city of Legazpi in Albay.The roofs of two evacuation centers were torn off by the force of the wind and the occupants moved to the ground floors, the provincial public safety chief Cedric Daep told DZBB radio station."Flash floods inundated our villages," said Carlos Irwin Baldo, the mayor of Camalig, near Legazpi."Our roads have a lot of debris from the mountains such as branches and sand, some of which came from Mayon [volcano]. Some roads are unpassable."So far, 346,993 people have been evacuated from their homes, Civil Defence chief Ricardo Jalad said.In Manila, residents were being evacuated from low-lying slum areas at risk of being inundated by several metres high storm surges.
