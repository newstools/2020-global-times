The exhibition area has increased 20 percent from last year. The CIIE, one of the world's largest trade shows that kicked off on Wednesday, showcases China's enormous opportunity for global companies after the country became the first major economy to achieve growth since COVID-19 crippled the world economy.For Hong Kong companies, the event has special significance. Liang Jiaxian, a manager with the Guangzhou branch of FS International, a Hong Kong-based international logistics company, told the Global Times that her company will introduce its new import logistics platform in the bonded area of Qianhai Bay in South China's Shenzhen - China's pioneering city of reform and opening-up - at the CIIE as the company has invested more resources and talent to cultivate the Chinese mainland market. FS International has doubled the area of its booth this year due to fruitful results from the previous trade show in 2019."Nearly 80 percent of our major projects nowadays are conducted in the mainland, even though we have been operating in Hong Kong for the past three decades," Liang told the Global Times on Wednesday."We hope to take part in the opportunity of dual circulation to improve our business, which is also focused on the integration of international and domestic operations," Liang said. Jacky Chung, director of the Chinese mainland for the HKTDC, said his agency will roll out targeted services to help more Hong Kong companies get involved in the internal circulation of the domestic market, as well as serve as a connecting point for the internal and external circulation components. Concrete measures will include helping Hong Kong companies to develop retail business in the mainland and tackling issues such as logistics and payment."We really appreciate that the motherland treats Hong Kong preferentially at this special time of COVID-19," Ken Wong, director of All Time Healthy Co, a Hong-Kong based healthcare product company, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The CIIE is a very good platform to act as a bridge between Hong Kong companies and mainland companies, he said."Hong Kong can take advantage of its position as a tax-free financial hub to introduce high-quality products to domestic markets through the platform of the CIIE," Wong said. This year is the third time that his company has participated in the CIIE, and it has booked two booths, just like last year.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the rebound was on the back of a recovering Chinese mainland economy."The opening-up policy mentioned by the central government to further open up the domestic market to Hong Kong's business sectors comes as good news for us," Chung said.Newspaper headline: HK companies seek growth points in mainland
