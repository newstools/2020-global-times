Additionally, demand for UK and Continental Europe flights dropped rapidly amid a resurgence of COVID-19 in many European countries.However, the cargo business continues to be the better performer. Following the National Day Holidays at the beginning of October, demand from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland rebounded quickly, driven by new electronic products. Return traffic from the Americas and Europe also improved month-on-month.The group said they are excited to fly between Hong Kong and Singapore as part of the new travel bubble.But the overall recovery is likely to be slow, and the group said it expects to operate well under 25 percent of 2019 passenger capacity in the first half of 2021 and below 50 percent for the entire year.As Hong Kong and multiple other markets are continuing to implement travel restrictions and quarantine measures, the group has axed a large number of flights amid the demand slump. Cathay Pacific said in October that it will cut approximately 8,500 positions in the entire group, accounting for around 24 percent of its staff, and one of its major regional airlines, Cathay Dragon, will cease operations to cope with the fallout from the global pandemic.Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
