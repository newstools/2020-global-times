All it needs is an excuse to break through the constitutional limits, which is why they keep hyping threats of neighboring countries like China and North Korea, Zhang explained.  "Japan is also working as a chess piece for the US to assist the latter to develop large warships as part of its strategic defense system," Zhang told the Global Times on Monday. Being placed on ships will increase the mobility of the interceptors, Zhang said. Chinese military analysts also pointed out that the planned Japanese warship will not be able to intercept advanced Chinese missiles such as the DF-17.The DF-17 is a short- to medium-range hypersonic missile that was showcased at the National Day military parade on October 1, 2019 in Beijing for the first time. Thanks to its ability to change trajectory in mid-flight at a very high speed, enemies have little chance of intercepting it, experts said.Regions including the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and Northeast Asia are all within the DF-17's range, as South Korea and Japan deploy US-made air defense systems, which are security threats to China, experts said.The decision on the Japanese ship plan will be made around the end of the year after the ministry receives an interim report in mid-November from two private firms familiar with the issue, Kyodo News said.
