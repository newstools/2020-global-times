In addition, all of its waste heat can be recovered and reused. The Capital Gymnasium can save more than 1 million kilowatts of electricity every year by using the heat source generated by carbon dioxide ice making.Among 15 ice rinks in the Beijing competition zone, seven ice rinks will adopt the carbon dioxide transcritical direct cooling technology which has been used in the Winter Olympics for the first time, making the Beijing Winter Olympics the first Winter Olympic Games to use carbon dioxide refrigerant on a large scale in history.All 15 ice surfaces in the Beijing competition consist of one in National Speed Skating Oval, two in National Indoor Stadium, two in National Aquatics Center, three in Wukesong Sports Center, five in Capital Gymnasium park and two in National Disabled Ice Sports Training Center.
