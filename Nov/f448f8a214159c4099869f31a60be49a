Chinese director Bao Beier noted the short films from these young directors were just as proficient as works from renowned directors.   Additionally, South Korean director Kim Sung-soo, who couldn't attend the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said in a video that the ongoing pandemic has hit the entire global film industry hard, but has also inspired young people to think about the changes that are taking place and complete works for future audiences. The winning directors will be able to attend a week-long tour of South Korean studios and hold talks with renowned South Korean directors.
