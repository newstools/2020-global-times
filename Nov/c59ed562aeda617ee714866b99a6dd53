Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of Chinese Foreign Ministry The Chinese Embassy in Australia on Monday said that it is deeply disappointed with the Australian trade minister's latest accusations against the embassy, as reported by The Australian newspaper, and said that "this is obviously not helpful to the China-Australia relationship."The remark came after Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham accused the Chinese Embassy of "coercion", claiming that the embassy in Canberra had escalated tensions between the two countries.The embassy replied by reiterating that the root cause of worsening  bilateral ties lies in Australia's repeated wrong acts and remarks on issues concerning China's core interests and major concerns, as well as its provocative and confrontational actions. Those who have caused problems should be the ones to solve the problems. The Australian side should take concrete actions to correct its mistakes, do more to enhance mutual trust and bilateral cooperation, act in line with the requirements of the China-Australia comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, and create a favorable atmosphere and conditions for bilateral cooperation, the embassy said. China's Foreign Ministry on Monday said that "communication channels between China and Australia at the working level has always been smooth," in response to media reports saying that Australian trade officials had hoped to talk to Chinese officials about current bilateral issues, but talks failed to be arranged."The current dilemma between the two countries is caused by the Australian side. We urge Australia to face the issues and correct its mistakes," said the ministry.
