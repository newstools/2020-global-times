Hospitals are on the brink of being overwhelmed in states including Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.The current wave of COVID-19 infections stretches across the whole country, and hospitalizations are rising in every region.

The seven-day average daily case count rose to a record-high of 109,663, according to the latest data of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.It marks the seventh straight day that the country has reported over 100,000 new infections.Texas has confirmed over one million COVID-19 cases as of early Wednesday, becoming the first US state to surpass one million confirmed cases.
