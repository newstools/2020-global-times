A BIT would provide greater market access. It would also reduce the ownership caps on foreign direct investment in both countries," Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale University, said during the discussion.

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership creates a free trade zone in the Asia-Pacific region that will encompass a third of the global economy. Chinese President Xi Jinping said at Friday's APEC summit that China will "favorably consider" joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Under current climate of rising protectionism, entrepreneurs and observers said China's opening-up will make the country more integrated in the global system while opening up more opportunities for foreign investment and injecting new vitality to global economic recovery. "China's new dual-circulation will not only help protect the Chinese economy from the volatility of the external market, but will also help drive future economic development in a balanced and sustainable way… All this reassures foreign investors of China's potential for a strong recovery and sustainable future growth," said Merlin Swire, chairman of John Swire&Sons, at the discussion.

The shortened negative list for foreign investment has also given foreign companies greater access to the Chinese market.China is revising its industry catalogue for the ninth time to encourage foreign investment, according to media reports.The inflow of more foreign investment will benefit China's economy and speed up its industrial upgrading, helping further tap into its market potential, said Zhao Ai, an executive vice president of the China Society of Economic Reform.About 70 percent of US companies are optimistic about the Chinese market over the next five years despite strained Sino-US relations, and 87 percent said they have no plans to move production lines out of China, according to the 2020 Membership Survey by the US-china Business Council in August.
