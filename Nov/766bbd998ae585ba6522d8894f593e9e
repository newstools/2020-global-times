However, we shall never disrespect or forget our national moral courage and history," a netizen said.Another comment read, "Spoof does not mean disrespect to culture."A staff at the shopping mall explained that the event was held in cooperation with a number of brands, and was not targeted at the theme of Halloween, Beijing Youth Daily reported. The shopping mall management later announced that the incident was being  investigated.  Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
