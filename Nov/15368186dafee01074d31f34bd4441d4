Especially after it expanded its membership to include India and Pakistan in June 2017, there has been great interest and attention as to the role that the new member states play in the SCO and the opportunities they may enjoy.In the post-epidemic era, whether anti-epidemic and economic cooperation could be the starting point of enhanced connections between India and other SCO member states is of great significance not only to the SCO, but also to India. While the SCO needs to gain the consensus of its member states to push forward initiatives, India also needs to leverage the multilateral organization to further expand the potential for its economic and trade cooperation with other countries.The Indian economy is under great pressure because of the epidemic. Getting out of its predicament requires not only its own efforts but also a helping hand from the outside world. The SCO is one of the few regional multilateral mechanisms India has joined, with the combined GDP of its member states exceeding $16 trillion after the 2017 expansion, representing a huge regional market. That's a starting point for India to integrate into the regional trade network.It is the common wish of SCO states to deepen cooperation in the post-epidemic era to speed up the recovery from the economic impact. Any initiative to promote industry chain collaboration or trade connectivity may need the consensus of all member states. While India has always been cautious in backing such initiatives, it is hoped that this time the country could put aside many geopolitical concerns to jointly participate in the economic and trade cooperation efforts.
