As Myanmar prepares for a general election next week, an opposition politician has found a new way of connecting with voters facing novel coronavirus restrictions and getting her message out.

Medical workers test the residents for the novel coronavirus on the Yangon-Mandalay highway in Myanmar on October 13.

With more than 50,000 coronavirus cases and more than 1,200 deaths, Myanmar is facing one of Southeast Asia's worst outbreaks of the virus and election campaigning across the country has been hit by curbs on movements and gatherings.The PPP is one of several new political parties emerging to challenge the popularity of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Suu Kyi's party is widely expected to win but smaller parties say they see opportunities with her support chipped away by growing ethnic conflict in some areas and a sluggish economy.The PPP is headed by a former member of parliament from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.
