At the same time, BMW Brilliance will be a stable source of profits in the future, and it will continue to launch new products and expand its scale, Xinhua reported, citing people inside the group. Huachen Automotive Group is a state-owned enterprise under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Liaoning Province. The group has two joint venture brands: BMW Brilliance and Renault Brilliance.This year, due to COVID-19, the operating conditions of Huachen's own brands have further deteriorated, and long-term accumulated debt problems have broken out.In August this year, many of the remaining bonds of Huachen plummeted. In October, Huachen was once again caught in a whirlpool of public criticism due to its failure to redeem private placement bonds of 1 billion yuan on schedule.As of October 23, there are 14 outstanding bonds of Huachen, with a total bond balance of 17.2 billion yuan, data from Guangfa Securities showed.
