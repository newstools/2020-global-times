China Japan Photo: IC The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed with the Global Times on Tuesday that it is considering setting up a new consulate in Central China's Wuhan and the matter is being pursued actively in wake of the pandemic, which observers say will better serve Japanese nationals in Central China, after the epidemic showed the importance of Wuhan.When asked by the Global Times on Tuesday, the ministry said it had applied to China regarding the establishment of a consulate in Wuhan in 2012, and the matter is being pursued in Japan for its early realization. The ministry did not reveal further details. According to Japanese media, the Japanese government had expressed willingness to build a consulate in Wuhan via diplomatic channels before November 23. The proposal had been brought up by Hiroyuki Ishige from the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) as early as August 2012, but was not followed up. When the Japanese government evacuated its nationals from Wuhan in January, the government had to seek assistance from the Japanese embassy in Beijing, which led to the suggestion of setting up a consulate in the city. Zhou Yongsheng, deputy director of the Japanese Studies Center at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the COVID-19 epidemic shed light on the importance of Wuhan to Japan, and that a consulate in the city would better help serve Japanese nationals in Central China.
