But observers have noted major obstacles to a lasting solution.Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya specialist at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, warned that foreign interests could easily derail the process.But the architect of the current UN process, Ghassan Salame, told AFP on Friday he had higher hopes than ever for peace, citing "an accumulation of positive factors."He noted that Libyans were increasingly hostile to foreign interference and the presence of mercenaries.Salame also said Turkey and Russia could see the fruition of infrastructure contracts worth billions of dollars, signed with the Gaddafi's government, but which Libyans were still keen to honor.AFP
