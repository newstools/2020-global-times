Premier Li's remarks show that China is willing and committed to sharing hydrological data during the dry season as well as the monsoon season. All riparian countries reached an agreement on the memorandum of understanding  to discuss China-proposed practical measures of sharing the Lancang River's hydrological data for the entire year with the Mekong countries on September 24, with representatives from the five countries applauding China's determination and efficiency in implementing its pledge.Representatives from five Mekong River countries expressed appreciation of China's efforts and efficient mobilization to promote its commitment of sharing year-round  hydrological data, and they valued the information China provided to help them better cope with droughts and others disasters.The information sharing under the platform covers the entire Lancang-Mekong River basin, according to information the Global Times obtained. It said the platform is to provide reliable forecasting and early warning services related to floods and droughts, while serving as an exchange of experience and technologies with member countries.The specific measures will be updated and complemented in close collaboration with the Mekong River Commission (MRC), it stressed.
