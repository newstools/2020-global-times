Cancer treatment, heart surgery, other life-saving procedures, all this could be put at risk if we do not get the virus under control," he said.Meanwhile, Johnson rejected accusations that Britain had been too slow to act, adding that he had to "try every possible option" before imposing a nationwide lockdown.Johnson announced Saturday that England will enter a month-long lockdown from Thursday in a bid to quell the resurgence of the coronavirus.Under the new measures, which will be effective until Dec. 2, people in England will only be allowed to leave their homes for specific reasons, such as education, work or food shopping.Pubs, bars and restaurants will close across the country except for takeaways. Non-essential shops, hairdressers and leisure and entertainment venues will also be shut. But unlike in the first lockdown, schools, colleges and universities will remain open.To bring life back to normal, countries, such as Britain, China, Russia and the United States, are racing against time to develop coronavirus vaccines.
