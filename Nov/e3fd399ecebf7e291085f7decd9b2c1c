A spokeswoman for the US Department of Justice said there was no deal and referred Reuters to earlier statements that said the case was dismissed in a sign of confidence in Mexican justice and because of diplomatic considerations.The US flew Cienfuegos back to Mexico on Wednesday.Newspaper headline: Mexico agreed with US Attorney General Barr to arrest drug capo
