US officials had pushed for talks for a phase two deal, but that was put on hold as the phase-one deal was being implemented and the US was involved in the tumult of the presidential election."When Biden takes office, the rules of the game [for trade negotiations] would likely change," Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday, adding that while Biden might choose to keep Trump's tariffs on about $250 billion worth of Chinese products, he could also be pressured to end the tariffs at the earliest possible time.Gao noted that more than 3,000 US businesses have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the high tariffs, and Biden, who is against tariffs, "could push the boat along with the current" to lift the tariffs by settling all those lawsuits.While Biden has not made his plan for resolving the trade dispute known, the long-time US politician has more than once slammed Trump's trade war. In his victory speech on Saturday, Biden did not mention China or trade, but during a speech focused on his foreign policy in July 2019, Biden said that the tariff war has only hurt US businesses and vast American consumers."President Trump may think he's being tough on China. All that he's delivered as a consequence of that is American farmers, manufacturers and consumers losing and paying more," Biden then said. Given Biden's "clear opposition" to tariffs, "he is unlikely to inherit and carry on Trump's tariffs legacy on his shoulders," Li Yong, a trade expert in Beijing who closely follows the China-US trade talks, told the Global Times on Sunday. "[Biden] will likely pursue new forms of trade talks with China… that might offer an opportunity for some constructive engagement with China."However, a different approach does not necessarily mean a resolution to the trade dispute, Li said. He noted that the rivalry between the world's two largest economies will most likely continue, but the competition ought to be kept on a healthy note, and cut-throat confrontation should be avoided by the politicians. While Biden has criticized Trump's tariffs, he has called for "building a united front" with America's allies to build up leverage against China. In September, Tony Blinken, a leading trade adviser to Biden, said that Biden would not rule out new tariffs on imports, though he called Trump's tariff war "fake toughness," according to US news website POLITICO.Biden's approach toward the trade talks would have a lot to do with "appearing tough on China" for the US domestic audience, which cast more uncertainty on the negotiations as well as the overall trade relationship between the world's two biggest economies in the coming four years, experts said.
