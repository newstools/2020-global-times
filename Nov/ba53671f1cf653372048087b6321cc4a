Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an apparent message to US President-elect Joe Biden, said on Sunday there should be no return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal abandoned by President Donald Trump.

But the deal, abandoned by Trump in 2018, did not restrict Iran's ballistic missile program nor its support for militia in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen."There must be no return to the previous nuclear agreement. We must stick to an uncompromising policy to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons," Netanyahu said in a speech in southern Israel.He did not mention Biden directly, but his comments were widely interpreted by Israeli media as a message to the incoming president not to bring the US back into the agreement. Netanyahu was a strong opponent of the 2015 accord, calling it a "very bad deal" in an address in 2015 to the US Congress that further strained his relationship with Obama.Newspaper headline: Israel: No going back to nuclear deal
