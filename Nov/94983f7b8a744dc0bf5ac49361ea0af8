He noted that there are many areas in which Chinese and French companies could engage in cooperation. Liu Yunfeng, executive vice president of Volkswagen Group China, said the Chinese government emphasis on the interaction of domestic circulation and external circulation in the dual-circulation development model has given the company confidence.Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times that China’s status as the world’s only growing major economy in 2020 and a super-sized market means the country will be a magnet for foreign companies in the years to come.Given the current international situation of trade protectionism, unilateralism and the lingering pandemic, foreign companies that are actively involved in China’s drive toward innovation and China’s innovation system are expected to do well while those who shut themselves off from China to protect their leading technologies will put themselves in a disadvantageous position as China’s super-sized market will give birth to alternatives.
