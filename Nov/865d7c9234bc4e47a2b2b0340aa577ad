The vast majority of them (724,349) are currently isolated at home because they are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms only. Another 33,610 Italians are hospitalized, 3,712 of them in intensive care units.On Thursday, 17,020 new recoveries were reported, which brought the total number of recoveries since the pandemic officially broke out here in late February to 489,987.There were also 653 new deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the country's death toll to 47,870.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday announced stricter measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, as 22,253 new infections were reported, bringing the tally to 731,588 in the country.Photo:XinhuaOverall, the country has registered 1,308,528 coronavirus cases (infections, recoveries and fatalities included).A total of 250,186 people were tested across the country in the last 24 hours, which pushed the number of tests carried out to 19.7 million. Health Ministry figures showed that 14.4 percent of Thursday's tests were positive. This ratio was 16.2 percent last Thursday, which suggests a moderate slowdown in the spread of the infection.At the press conference, Arcuri compared the current epidemiological situation to that during the first COVID-19 wave in spring."Today, 95.1 percent of all those actively infected are cured at home because they have mild symptoms or none at all; at the peak of the first wave, the respective figure was 51 percent," he said."At the same time, some 0.5 percent of the actively positive cases are treated in intensive care units today. At the peak of the epidemic in spring this figure was 6.7 percent."This change in the composition of the affected population suggests that we are able to trace the virus better and earlier, and therefore to isolate and cure the infected people while the virus has not yet caused its heaviest effects," he said.
