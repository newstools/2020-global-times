Promoting the formation of a grand and smooth domestic economic cycle can better attract global resources, Xi said.Security has to be at least as important as development to manage growing risks the society is faced with, Yan said, noting various crises the world is facing such as public health crisis, climate change and the turbulent global environment.Xi said that after "comprehensively considering various factors," the proposed draft adopts a "qualitative expression and a quantitative approach" to the economic development goals by 2035, noting that the mid- and long-term planning goals should pay more attention to the optimization of the economic structure, and guide all parties to focus on improving the quality and efficiency of development.The change of tone in China's economic development target is in line with the country's development situation, as China is in pursuit of high-quality development rather than quantitative growth, Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Cong said it's also possible that China will continue to downplay the GDP target in the future, as conducting all work around a specific growth target may lead to trifles and neglect the essentials, adding that structural adjustments and upgrading will be the primary task for China no matter how the external environment evolves.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, China opted for not setting a specific numerical growth target for this year in the Government Work Report at the two sessions in May.Nevertheless, experts said "seeking improvement in stability" does not mean there will be no target at all, but we will set specific targets based on the actual development progress, and better coordinate policies to cope with new challenges while ensuring that long-term goals are met.The proposed goal for doubling 2020's GDP of around 100 trillion yuan in 2035 could mean an annual real growth target of about 3.5 percent, said Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association."I think those targets are very pragmatic as they reflect our advantages and long-term development goals, as well as the many challenges," Tian told the Global Times.
