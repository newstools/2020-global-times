Spanish painter Soledad Sevilla was on Monday awarded the highly prestigious 2020 Velazquez Prize for Plastic Arts by the Spanish Ministry of Culture and Sports.The prize, which is endowed with 100,000 euros ($118,400), rewards Seville "for the solvency with which she transits between the plane and the space."The jury, which met in Madrid on Monday, said that Sevilla's work "reflects on different artistic traditions and cultures, which embraces and incorporates the present, always in the tension between nature and architecture."The Velazquez Prize has been awarded by Spain's minister of culture every year since 2002 with the aim of granting institutional recognition for the lifetime work of Spanish or Spanish-American artists whose careers have been especially significant in the field of plastic arts.Sevilla was born in Valencia in 1944. She studied at the Sant Jordi School of Fine Arts in Barcelona and thanks to her outstanding talent, she obtained several scholarships that allowed her to reside at Harvard University in Boston in the US.Â
