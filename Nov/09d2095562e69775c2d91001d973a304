As of Monday night, a total of 1,660 people were tested, including guests and staff at the hotel where the man stayed during the quarantine period.A thorough disinfection was carried out in all venues that the patient could have contaminated, according to Chengdu health authorities.The asymptomatic patient had been infected abroad, had a low viral load, and has developed protective antibodies against the novel coronavirus. Since tests on related close contacts and the external environment all came back negative, further risk of spread or a cluster outbreak is low, the Chengdu health authority said.As winter approaches and the epidemic overseas is still rampant, health authorities have warned of sporadic outbreaks, reminding the public to take the necessary protective measures.  Deputy Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui also warned last week that China will face a tough challenge this winter. China has reported more than 3,600 imported cases, and the number has increased rapidly since October. Global Times
