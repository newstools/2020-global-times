Each vehicle is monitored to ensure the safety of the sheep in the transportation process,” said Xiao Yanyong, president of Wuhan Hanou International Logistics Co.Each cold chain truck is equipped with a container with a cooling system and is driven by an experienced driver. One driver, Jiang Zhixiong, said that he had 17 years of driving experience and was “determined to complete the task satisfactorily,” according to Changjiang Daily."This conveys the regards of the Mongolian government and people to the people of Hubei who have made great contributions in the fight against the epidemic," said Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, at a regular press conference on October 22."As a Mongolian proverb goes, the gift of a needle in bad times is worth more than a camel in good times. The 30,000 sheep show Mongolia's firm support to the Chinese government and people in their fight against the epidemic, and it vividly demonstrates the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind and the sincere friendship between the two countries and peoples,” said Zhao.
