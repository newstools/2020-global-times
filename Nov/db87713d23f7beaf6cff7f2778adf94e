Among them, Tencent rose more than 5 percent, Alibaba rose nearly 4 percent; Meituan and JD both hit record highs in intraday trading.Market analysts said the rally in the China market was also due to China's commitment of opening-up further and becoming a greater market shared by the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has crippled the global economy.The trend is in line with the momentum in the US stock market on Wednesday, when US stocks closed sharply higher after Joe Biden gained swing-state votes.The broad S&P 500 index gained 2.2 percent to 3,443.44, its biggest one-day point and percentage increase since June.
