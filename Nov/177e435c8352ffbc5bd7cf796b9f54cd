Hundreds of millions of Indians in north India woke up on Sunday to toxic air following Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, after many revelers defied bans on using firecrackers to celebrate.

Heavy smog covers Rashtrapati Bhavan near Rajpath in New Delhi, India, on Tuesday. The national capital's air quality remained ''severe'' for the fifth consecutive day with Air Quality Index reading of 474.

It's like a form of Hindu- freedom battle cry," Tarun Vijay, a senior leader from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, posted on Twitter late on Saturday.Â Newspaper headline: North India chokes on smog from Diwali festival
