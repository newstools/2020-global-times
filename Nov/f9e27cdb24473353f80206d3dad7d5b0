Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDD), said on Thursday that the outbreaks in Kashi and Shanghai both started with containers from international freight.All freight in the winter has become a type of cold-chain storage as winter approaches, making it a potential source of COVID-19, Wu said.Moreover, disinfection in low temperatures and freezing environments has now become a new challenge in combatting COVID-19, as low temperatures can significantly "play down" the effectiveness of disinfectants or sanitization approaches, and sometimes even makes common approaches completely ineffective, Zhang Liubo, chief expert on disinfection from the Chinese CDC, said on Wednesday.
