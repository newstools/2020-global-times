In 1905, Tan Xinpei performed the opera Dingjun Mountain in the film of the same name, which is considered by many as the birth of Chinese cinema. Launched by the Capital Star Art Film Theaters League, the event will also host forums to discuss issues such as the addition of modern elements when producing traditional Chinese Opera films as well as how to improve the integration of traditional Chinese Opera and film in China.
