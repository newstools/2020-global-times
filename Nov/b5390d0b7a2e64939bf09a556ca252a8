The initial two launches in October 2018 and March 2019 failed.Yao Bowen, a vice president of iSpace, told the Global Times on Monday that it is important for Chinese commercial space players at the moment to keep their feet on the ground, even if "their heads are in the clouds" as they pursue their products and technologies.Yao said the company is focused on developing scale launches according to real market demand.The reusable liquid-oxygen methane engine, independently developed by iSpace, has the ability to carry out secondary-stage ignition and large-scale continuous variable thrusting. These features are the keys to recovery and reuse of the launch vehicle.The first liquid-fueled launch attempt by a private firm in China could happen in two to three years, Huang predicted. In an interview with the Global Times at the end of 2018, Yang Yiqiang, the first commander-in-chief of the Long March 11 solid-fuel carrier rocket project, said that industry watchers were not bullish on SpaceX before 2010."The situation has changed, thanks to talent mobility. NASA's space shuttle program came to an end with the Atlantis' Space Shuttle launch in 2011, and SpaceX succeeded in garnering talent," Yang said, adding that the US aerospace manufacturer's rise to prominence can also be attributed to shared intellectual property enabled through a set of regulations. In China's case, the so-called national team including China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp - the main contractor for China's space program - is a collection of companies shouldering social responsibilities as well as striving to prove themselves commercially viable, Yang said, calling for the creation of "a mechanism to protect the national team's interests while ensuring its intellectual property is converted to social benefits."  Huang said that the national team is technologically and financially competent in mounting human flights, but the involvement of private partners in human missions won't be easy, which will require a mixed-ownership reform of the state-owned champions.
