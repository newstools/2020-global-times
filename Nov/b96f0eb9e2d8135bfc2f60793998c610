Photo:VCGChinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday reassured global businesses that China will continue to open up its market and share more opportunities for common development with other countries, despite growing risks and uncertainties brought about by rising unilateralism, protectionism and bullying practices.In a keynote speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Dialogue via video link, Xi called on the business community to contribute to promoting openness and development and advance trade and investment liberalization to ensure the Asia-Pacific takes the lead in achieving economic recovery."We welcome cooperation with every other region, country, or company that wants to do so," Xi said."I wish to reiterate that China's commitment to opening-up is strong, and that China will open its door still wider to the world," Xi said. China will continue to advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation through negotiation, high-standard free trade agreements with more countries, and actively engage in bilateral, multilateral and regional mechanisms for trade and investment cooperation.As a response to Western voices hyping concerns that the Chinese economy is “turning inward,” Xi stressed, “We will not reverse course or run against historical trend by ‘decoupling’ or forming a small circle to keep others out. By fostering a new development paradigm, we are not pursuing a closed-door circulation, but open and mutually reinforcing domestic and international circulations.”During the speech, Xi also stressed the importance of close interactions and economic cooperation within the Asia Pacific region. "The Asia-Pacific is our shared home. To sustain peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region meets the interests of us all," he said.
