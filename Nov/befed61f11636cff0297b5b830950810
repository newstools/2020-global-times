The movie grossed more than $455 million around the world as of Monday, topping all the films that have been released.Directed by Guan Hu, The Eight Hundred depicts Chinese soldiers' four-day defense of a warehouse against the invading Japanese army during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, regarded as one of the most tragic battles faced by Chinese people in World War II. A Twitter user commented about the film, saying that "it is a great movie worth watching. I am always intrigued by those events and lives during the war."Shi Wenxue, a film critic and teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, recalled what impressed him most about the film."There was a scene in the movie with a river separating two parts during the battle. One is the warehouse where Chinese soldiers are fighting a bloody battle and on the other side of the river, foreign people and some rich Chinese people are watching the battle. This is a reflection of history," Shi told the Global Times on Wednesday.No one can avoid disaster, and if you look at others' troubles with indifference, you will be stuck in the troubles sooner or later, he noted.Shi confirmed that the film has its merits but he was not optimistic about its chances of success at the Oscars."I think the odds of the movie winning are not high. 1917, another war film released last year, is better in terms of technology and overseas audiences are more familiar with the subject, but it still did not win the award."
