California voters have backed an initiative expanding a data privacy law criticized by rights watchdogs as having worrying "loopholes" for firms such as Google and Facebook.

The California Consumer Privacy Act became law at the start of 2020, the toughest of its kind in the US.Like the European Data Protection Regulation, applied in the European Union since May 2018, the California law guarantees rights regarding control of online data.Alastair Mactaggart, the wealthy San Francisco real estate developer behind the original law and the act refining it, called its passage historic."We are at the beginning of a journey that will profoundly shape the fabric of our society by redefining who is in control of our most personal information and putting consumers back in charge of their own data," Mactaggart said.California ACLU officials, however, opposed the initiative, contending it would undermine privacy and increase the burden on people to protect themselves from abuses of their data by big tech companies. The ACLU of Northern California argued that the initiative was "full of loopholes." Flaws in the initiative include "carve-outs written by the credit-reporting industry and new ways to keep consumers in the dark about what companies are doing with their personal information," according to the ACLU. The initiative limits businesses that have to comply with the law to only companies that buy or sell data of at least 100,000 households a year, the ACLU noted.Critics point out that Facebook or Google could claim to be exempt regarding online data they don't pay for but is used to target advertising.
