Any party which garners more than 1 percent of the ballots will be allocated seats in proportion to their shares of votes, according to the CEC.According to Georgia's constitutional amendments, which were passed in June, the parliamentary poll in 2020 should be held under a mixed electoral system, with 120 members of parliament to be elected via party lists and the remaining 30 running in single-member majoritarian districts.An election bloc or party which receives less than 40.54 percent of all votes in the proportional elections will not be able to form a government.The ruling Georgian Dream party previously won the parliamentary poll in 2012 and 2016, after defeating the United National Movement in the elections.With votes from more than 72 percent of precincts counted, the Georgian Dream led the opposition by 48.5 percent to 45 percent in a proportional ballot that will decide 120 of the 150 seats in the legislature, the Central Election Commission said.The ruling party's leader, billionaire ex-prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, said his party "has won elections for the third time in a row.""Georgians have elected a great team," he added.But opposition leader, exiled former president Mikhail Saakashvili, said Georgian Dream "is massively falsifying election results" and announced a "mass mobilisation [of supporters] to defend the votes." In an unprecedented show of unity months ahead of the vote, Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM) and smaller opposition groups joined forces to challenge the ruling party.Newspaper headline: Georgia ruling party claims election win
