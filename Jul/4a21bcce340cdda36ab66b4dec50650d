However, the online contest is also a meaningful attempt, and may become the 'new normal' of overseas Chinese teaching and learning activities in the future," said Huang Xilian, China's ambassador to the Philippines, in the opening remarks."I hope that all Filipinos who are interested in learning Chinese can take the Chinese language as a bridge to better understand China and strive to promote the friendship between the two countries," Huang added.The "Chinese Bridge" is an annual competition aimed at arousing the enthusiasm of students in various countries to learn Chinese and strengthen the world's understanding of the Chinese language as well as culture.Joseph Angeles, president of AUF, said in the finals that the "Chinese Bridge" contest is evidence of the friendship between the Philippine and Chinese peoples, which helps bring up more talents devoted to cultural exchanges between the two countries.The contest in the Philippines has become important as it builds a communication bridge between young Chinese and Filipinos, according to the Confucius Institute at AUF, which has been holding the finals of the "Chinese Bridge" contest for three years.
