Masks are "a simple thing, but it's about changing habits, it's about becoming a simple part of your routine."Australia has recorded about 11,800 coronavirus cases, a fraction of what has been seen in other countries or even some US states, but an outbreak of community transmission in Victoria has been growing, prompting authorities to impose stricter social distancing measures."Community transmission is difficult and challenging," Australia's Health Minister Greg Hunt told a televised briefing. "That remains our single greatest threat.Victoria became the first state in Australia, a country of a loose federal system, to require masks for part of its population.New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state that had moved to relax its social distancing guidelines earlier in July, has since moved to restrict again some social mingling as cases have been growing.On Sunday, NSW reported 18 new infections, its highest in three months. The transmission rate in the state is higher than in Victoria, causing concerns. "People are urged to avoid nonessential travel and gatherings," NSW Deputy Chief Health Officer Jeremy McAnulty said in a video statement. "Of particular concern is transmission in venues such as hotels and restaurants, the gym and social gatherings."Newspaper headline: Australia’s Victoria requires masks for Melbourne hit by novel coronavirus
