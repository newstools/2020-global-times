Wong did not reply, but stepped back after the man criticized him for about 15 minutes. The man was later escorted by police away from the scene. Chinese netizens on social media platform Weibo praised the man and nearby residents, and said, "More and more Hong Kong residents will stand out like this man with the national security law for Hong Kong taking effect."Many also called on authorities to immediately arrest secessionists like Wong, and ridiculed him for being a "rat running across the street with everybody shouting to smack it."Joshua Wong, along with Nathan Law and Agnes Chow, announced their withdrawal from pro-secession group Demosisto last week, which analysts believed showed the deterrent effect of the national security law for Hong Kong Global Times
