Also, IC-related subjects will have access to more resources and funding.In recent years, China has been fast-tracking the development of the domestic chip industry amid the US' efforts to cut chip supplies to Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE.  And local talent in the field will be critical in aiding China's efforts to break through the US-led blockade. Roughly 30,000 students in China graduate from IC-related programs every year, according to an industry paper. But the talent gap in China is now estimated to be 300,000, and is projected to rise as demand for chips expands, according to Xu Wei, secretary-general of the Shanghai IC Industry Association. Fudan University is one of many Chinese universities that have started preparing to offer IC programs. It is working toward introducing an IC Science and Engineering degree, focusing on core engineering issues in IC design, manufacturing, packing and testing.Global Times
