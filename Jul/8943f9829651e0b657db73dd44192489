The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs again reminded students who plan to study in Australia to assess the risk and carefully make their decision, noting that the study and travel warnings for Australia previously announced by the Chinese side came in response to a spike of discriminatory attacks against Chinese in Australia.Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the ministry, made the remarks on Thursday afternoon at a press conference.Zhao also reminded Chinese residents in Australia to pay attention to their personal safety."We once again urge the Australian side to face up to the problem and take concrete measures to safeguard the safety and rights of Chinese in Australia," said Zhao.The comment came after a surge in discrimination cases against overseas Chinese, Chinese students studying in Australia and even other Asians. Some of them have suffered violent attacks, and their physical and mental health and even their lives have been seriously threatened, Australian media reported.On July 4, a Chinese student from the University of South Australia was severely injured after being verbally abused and physically attacked by three local men near Adelaide's Chinatown.In June, the Chinese government issued a study warning and travel alert to Australia, as the country has seen a significant rising trend of racial discrimination and violence against Chinese and other Asian people. Zhao said the warnings are responsible practices.Echoing the Chinese study and travel alert for Australia, a Chinese student surnamed Wu from the University of Adelaide told the Global Times on Thursday that he has seen more local cases of discrimination and anti-China attacks, especially amid the coronavirus pandemic.In the wake of the incident of July 4, local Chinese and Chinese students are organizing a demonstration against discrimination and racial attacks and Australian media smearing Chinese."The demonstration is likely to be held this weekend," Wu noted.
