It could also gather intelligence on PLA deployments on islands and reefs.The US Navy has been holding naval exercises with Australia and Japan in the Philippine Sea. When Australian warships traveled close to the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea last week, they encountered the Chinese Navy, Australian media outlet ABC News reported on Wednesday.China also conducted maritime attack drills in the South China Sea and deployed warplanes in an island in the region amid the US aggression, Chinese media reported.In the Yellow Sea, the RC-12X could gather communication data and radar signals, Wei said, noting that it could seek to eavesdrop on PLA flotilla in the region.Citing an image by commercial satellites first circulated on foreign social media, Chinese new portal Sina reported on Tuesday that the PLA Navy aircraft carrier Liaoning was found in the Yellow Sea training with the Hulunhu replenishment ship on Monday.The US has been frequently conducting reconnaissance operations in the South China Sea, on the coastal regions of the Chinese mainland and near the island of Taiwan in the past weeks, reports said.The US military aircraft's activities on Wednesday also coincided with the US demand that China close its Houston consulate. Observers in the US feared that escalating China-US tensions could lead to a military conflict.Wei said that the US' political provocations are closely related to its military activities, as it is trying to defame China and stir up trouble militarily at the same time.Neither China nor the US wants to engage each other in a military conflict, as that would be a disaster for both countries and the world, analysts said, noting that while the US' close-up reconnaissance activities show the US military is preparing and aiming to gain certain advantages, the PLA is also making preparations, as its capability and determination will serve as a powerful deterrent.As a country from outside the region, the US military's frequent presence and muscle-flexing in the South China Sea is not wanted by many countries in the region, Wei said.
