China's Foreign Ministry on Monday announced sanctions against the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Samuel Brownback, US Senator Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Republican Chris Smith, following the US' sanctions on Chinese officials over the Xinjiang issue. Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the announcement at Monday's media briefing. Hua said that China will impose reciprocal sanctions on the mentioned commission and four individuals effective immediately in response to US sanctions on one Xinjiang government department and four Chinese officials.  The US' actions seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, violated basic norms governing international relations and seriously damaged China-US relations, and China firmly opposes and strongly condemns them, Hua said. Xinjiang affairs are purely China's internal affairs. The US has no right or qualification to intervene arbitrarily.We urge the US side to immediately revoke its wrong decision and stop any words and deeds that interfere in China's internal affairs and harm China's interests. China will make further responses as the situation develops, Hua said. Global Times Newspaper headline: China imposes reciprocal sanctions on US officials, organization over Xinjiang Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
