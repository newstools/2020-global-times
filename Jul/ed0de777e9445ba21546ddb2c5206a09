The goals of the trip would be to "establish the systems necessary for crisis communications and reinforce our intentions to openly compete in the international system in which we all belong," he was quoted as saying.Several experts on military relations between the two countries told the Global Times on Tuesday that China needs time to find out if such a stance represents genuine goodwill or is merely a "smoke bomb."Global Times
