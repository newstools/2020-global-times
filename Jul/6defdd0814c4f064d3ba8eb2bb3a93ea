Justin Trudeau Photo: ICCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Monday for taking part in a Cabinet decision to use a charity he and his family have worked with to administer a C$900 million ($663.4 million) student grant program.Trudeau is facing a third investigation for conflict of interest in a little over three years after his government tapped WE Charity Canada on June 25 to manage the program."I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family's history, and I'm sincerely sorry about not having done that," Trudeau said.It is the second time in less than a year that the prime minister has apologized publicly for his actions in a live, nationally televised news conference. The first time was in September after decades-old images of him in blackface emerged."I was very aware that members of my family had worked with and contributed to the WE organization, but I was unaware of the details of their remuneration," Trudeau said.WE Charity disclosed last week that from 2016-20 it paid honoraria to Trudeau's mother, Margaret, amounting to C$250,000 for speaking at some 28 events, while his brother, Alexandre, received about C$32,000.Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, have regularly participated in WE Charity events, and Gregoire Trudeau hosts a podcast on the charity's website for which she is not paid.Reuters
