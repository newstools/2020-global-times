It serves to isolate and stigmatize individuals who are, or are perceived to be of Chinese or other East Asian descent," said Achiume.She stressed that such irresponsible and discriminatory rhetoric used by some US politicians "is no minor issue," as populist regimes in many countries are exploiting and fueling national anxieties about the virus and doubling down on demonization of racial, ethnic and religious minorities while flouting checks and balances on their power."Not surprisingly, leaders who are attempting to attribute COVID-19 to certain national or ethnic groups are the very same nationalist populist leaders who have made racist and xenophobic rhetoric central to their political platforms," she argued. "Political responses to COVID-19 that stigmatize, exclude, and make certain populations more vulnerable to violence are inexcusable, unconscionable, and inconsistent with states' international human rights law obligations," she said. Brij Mohan, Dean Emeritus and Professor of the School of Social Work at Louisiana State University, noted that poor and black families in the US have disproportionately suffered the coronavirus pandemic. The inequality engine is driven by ideologies that sustain white privilege and systemic brutality and injustice, Mohan argued, saying a pernicious belief system breeds inequality and injustice that calls for radical transformations to combat the politics of pandemics.Serges Alain Djoyou Kamga, Professor of Human Rights from Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute at University of South Africa, also recognized the "color-coded" and "white-over-black" ideologies "are well hidden under the formal equality echoed by the 14th amendment of the USA Constitution." He said the US is suffering dilemmas and challenges in combating racism and racial discrimination."Racial hate speech has emerged in diverse countries during the epidemic, and it has not only affected many ethnic minority groups, but also posed a threat to international solidarity in the fight against the epidemic," Sun Shiyan, the professor of Institute of International Law at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said during the seminar.Taking the instance of how the Chinese community in the Netherlands "has suffered and is still suffering from racism," Tom Zwart, Director of the Cross-cultural Human Rights Centre, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, underlined that the Chinese community has now moved from indirectly challenging racist comments to tackling them head on. The assertiveness of the younger generation played a decisive role in this transformation to a direct public rebuke, he added.Virus-related discrimination against any group or ethnicity in the name of "free speech" is unacceptable, said Mao Junxiang, Executive Director of Central South University Human Rights Center, Vice dean of School of Law at Central South University.Mao urged Western politicians and media to restore their social responsibility and refrain from spreading racist and xenophobic remarks that are detrimental to international cooperation in fighting the epidemic."The Chinese people have made great contributions to international public health and a lot have been sacrificed in providing valuable experience on how to  fight the virus," he said. "They deserve the support of the global community rather than groundless accusations."
