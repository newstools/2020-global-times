"In the past, we conducted simple training, and mistakes happened."Jaruvat said 150 police officers and civil servants from across the country had this week started a training course to help them better identify and deal with victims of trafficking.Thailand has 1,640 specialist anti-trafficking officers nationwide. The country secured 194 trafficking convictions in 2019.Newspaper headline: Thailand to tackle human trafficking
