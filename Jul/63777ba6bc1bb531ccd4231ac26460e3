But the river spans a large area and it is inevitable that some branches and regions will suffer, Li noted.She warned that the real ordeal for China will come if flooding continues to ravage upper and middle streams of the Yangtze River.The expert said it is difficult to predict whether the flood will recede in the near future. “It largely depends on the location and the amount of rain. The rainfall is moving north and will influence the Yellow River and other rivers in the north,” said Li, noting that unlike the south, rivers in the north did not experience much flooding in the past, which makes it hard for them to resist floods. The key for flood prevention work at this moment would be to transfer people who have been affected, and to closely monitor big rivers that are ravaged, in order to make early arrangements and prepare for the rescue work.
