She was believed to have left wearing pajamas and a pair of sports shoes, and didn't take other belongings such as her cellphone or ID, Xinhua reported on Sunday. The police have checked all surveillance cameras in the building, residential compound, and nearby streets and searched the basements, rooftops and swimming pools in the compound but failed to find any trace of the woman. Lai's sudden disappearance soon triggered widespread speculation with many netizens pointing a finger at Xu."People might think we had a quarrel or something, prompting her to leave like this, but actually we have not had any conflicts recently," Xu said in an interview with a Zhejiang-based news program on July 15. Despite his unflappable demeanor, many netizens said that it was unusual the Xu waited 36 hours to call the police. The case is still under investigation, said the police's statement.
