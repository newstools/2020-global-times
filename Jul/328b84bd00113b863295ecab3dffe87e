The probe is one of three racing to the Red Planet, with Chinese and US rockets also taking advantage of the Earth and Mars being unusually close: a mere hop of 55 million kilometers.Hope - or Al-Amal in Arabic - is expected to reach Mars's orbit by February 2021, marking the 50th anniversary of the unification of the UAE, an alliance of seven emirates. Once there, it will loop the planet for a whole Martian year, or 687 days.The goal is to provide a comprehensive image of weather dynamics in the Red Planet's atmosphere. The probe is expected to detach from the launch rocket about an hour after blast-off,  the UAE Mars mission's deputy project manager Sarah al-Amiri said.
