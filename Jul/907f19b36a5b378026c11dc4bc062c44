People traveling from Hong Kong also have to accept a 14-day medical quarantine. The announcements came as neighboring Hong Kong has been hit by a third wave of the coronavirus this month, recording 63 new cases on Thursday, setting a single-day record. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government issued a statement late on Thursday reminding residents of the new COVID-19 prevention and control measures in Guangdong, and expressing understanding toward the measures. As the local virus situation has become severe recently, some in Hong Kong may wish to go north to Guangdong, which would unduly burden boundary control points and health quarantine facilities in the Chinese mainland, the Hong Kong government said. Guangdong and Hong Kong have been in discussion in the spirit of joint prevention and control of the virus in both places, the statement read. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
