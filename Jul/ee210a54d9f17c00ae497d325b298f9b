It also has a type of fourth generation fighter jet, the J-20.After studying at the academy for a year, the pilot cadets completed all training programs, including solo flights, nighttime aviation, weapon deployment, tactical formation flying and air combat.The JL-10 training program has helped the Air Force to add fighter jet introduction training to advanced training program, and broadened the training approach to develop new pilot talent, the report said.In this new training model, the trainees focus more on tactical training, air combat and free operation, emphasizing the development of tactical awareness with enhanced difficulty and intensity in weapons trainings. Compared to previous cadets, the graduating cadets who trained on the JL-10 used twice as many munitions, according to the report.The PLA Air Force previously used basic trainer aircraft CJ-6, intermediate trainer jet K-8 to train pilot cadets, military observers noted.Known as the L-15 for its export model, the JL-10 is a newly developed training and light combat aircraft that uses advanced technology, including an advanced aerodynamic design, a fly-by-wire control system, and an open avionics structure. It is equipped with many advanced technologies that other Chinese trainers, like the K-8, do not have, analysts said.China will train more pilots with advanced aircraft, as more fighter jets are being commissioned by the Air Force, experts said.Global Times
