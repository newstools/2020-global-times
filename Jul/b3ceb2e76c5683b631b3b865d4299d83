The new chip rule, effective May 15 but with a 120-day grace period, will also hit Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the biggest contract chipmaker and key Huawei supplier, which could hinder the production and research of Huawei's high-end products such as its flagship phones and PCs.However, leaping the hurdles it is facing, the firm said in its first half report that "the complex external environment makes open collaboration and trust in global value chains more important than ever. Huawei has promised to continue fulfilling its obligations to customers and suppliers, and to survive, forge ahead, and contribute to the global digital economy and technological development, no matter what future challenges the company faces."The Chinese 5G frontrunner remains in troubled water in Europe, which is being pressured by the US, as many countries are reportedly reconsidering or scaling back cooperation with the firm despite its technology advancements and price advantage.The UK is reconsidering its decision to allow Huawei's access to parts of its 5G network construction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior security advisers will meet on Tuesday to decide Huawei's future in the UK, as officials draw up plans to cut the company out of fifth generation mobile networks, said a Bloomberg report.Germany and France are also reportedly reassessing the role of the company in their 5G networks.As countries around the globe grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, information and communications technologies (ICT) have become a crucial tool for combating the virus, and an engine for economic recovery. Huawei reiterated its commitment to working with carriers and industry partners to maintain stable network operations, accelerate digital transformation, and support efforts to contain local outbreaks and reopen local economies, said the firm."The pressure on the firm will only get greater in the second half of the year, and the Trump administration will definitely not be reconciled," Fang said."We have no other choice but to keep moving forward," a Chinese netizen said after Huawei released its half-year financial report which showed the company's revenue growth is undaunted by the reckless crackdown by the US government.
