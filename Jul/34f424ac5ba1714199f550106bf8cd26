She has proposed that foreign judges be barred from national security trials. She also contends that judges who hear national security cases in Hong Kong should comprehensively understand and master the Chinese Constitution and the Chinese language.

Judges who have dual nationality or have made a pledge to another country aren't fit to hear national security cases, she added. The passed law, however, does not specify the nationalities of judges. Article 44 of the law empowers the chief executive to designate a panel of judges to handle cases concerning offenses endangering national security. The chief executive may consult the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal. Chan believes this article is a combination of merits of the two laws - the national security law and the Basic Law, and does not conflict with article 92 of the Basic Law. Article 92 stipulates, "Judges and other members of the judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be chosen on the basis of their judicial and professional qualities and may be recruited from other common law jurisdictions."

As for the circumstances when "a major and real threat to national security has occurred" that would lead to the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong to exercise jurisdiction over a case, as stipulated in article 55 of the national security law, the power of interpretation shall be rested in the NPC Standing Committee to define the threat."There should not be too many restrictions on defining such a threat, as the aim of the national security law for Hong Kong is to solve problems that Hong Kong itself cannot solve," said Chan.
