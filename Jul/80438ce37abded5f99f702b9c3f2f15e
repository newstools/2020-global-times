Confidence among major Japanese manufacturers has plunged to its worst level since the global financial crisis, a key survey showed on Wednesday, as the coronavirus dries up global demand.

Data released on Tuesday showed the jobless level rose from 2.6 percent to 2.9 percent.The low unemployment figure reflects a shrinking workforce given Japan's rapidly ageing population, 28 percent of which is 65 or over.Analysts said millions of people had simply left the workforce during the pandemic to care for families. Millions are also on furlough, meaning that the unemployment data may be considerably less rosy than it looks, said Shimamine. "One estimate says the jobless rate is actually 11 percent if you incorporate those on furlough," he told AFP.Once it hit, there were nomandatory lockdowns in the country. But that, coupled with a shuttering of the country's borders, battered tourism and consumer spending, especially for the hospitality industry.Daichi Kawabata, economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said the negative sentiment expressed in the survey reflected fears that economic activity would never return to pre-pandemic levels.
