Rescuers work at the site where a passenger bus collided with a semitruck along the highway connecting the capital Tegucigalpa with the southern part of Honduras, on Feb. 5, 2017. (Xinhua/Rafael Ochoa)Â Seven people were killed on Sunday in northern Honduras when their vehicle skidded off the highway and crashed into a billboard pole before turning over. Another person was injured in the accident, which occurred along a stretch of highway between the towns of Sambo Creek and Corozal, police said. All the victims were members of Central America's Garifuna indigenous community who were returning home early Sunday after attending a party the night before in Sambo Creek, police said. Five of the victims died on site. The other two died at a nearby hospital, where the injured person was also taken. Police said the force of the impact indicated speeding was the likely cause of the accident. Roadway crashes are the second cause of death in Honduras, after homicides, though this year has seen fewer accidents due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures.
