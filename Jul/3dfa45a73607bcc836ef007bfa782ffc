Drivers who are psychologically unhealthy, physically unfit or angry will not be allowed to start work.The company will also check the number of routes, including those that pass by rivers, lakes, cliffs and bridges, listing these routes into the risk control system. The company will monitor drivers in real time through driver behavior intervention systems and intelligent dispatching platforms, and will give timely warnings and corrections to those who violate regulations and drive dangerously.Other parts of China, including Beijing, Wuhan in Central China's Hubei Province and Kunming in Southwest China's Yunnan Province, have carried out similar public transportation safety campaigns from Thursday.Beijing Public Transport said it would pay close attention to key drivers and dangerous road sections, and strengthen investigations of conflicts and disputes.The company noted they would assess the risks of policies and major decisions taken during the epidemic and the summer holidays, and strengthen the monitoring of public opinion to prevent conflicts intensifying during key periods.The campaigns came after China's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) urged authorities across the country to strengthen bus safety measures on Wednesday.The MPS urged bus companies to strengthen safety management and establish and improve safety and risk prevention mechanisms, strengthen routine training for bus drivers and conduct regular drills. The Ministry of Transport on Tuesday urged public transport companies to pay close attention to the mental and physical conditions of drivers in the wake of the incident. Global Times
