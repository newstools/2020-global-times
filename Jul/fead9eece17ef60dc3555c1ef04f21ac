(Xinhua/Cai Yang)Chinese space authorities are inviting the general public to share in the excitement of the successful launch of the Tianwen-1 Mars probe mission on Thursday by holding an official global naming campaign for the country's first Mars rover on Friday.The global naming campaign was hosted by the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of China's National Space Administration in collaboration with the Tianwen-1 project contractors including the China Academy of Space Technology and China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. China's search engine giant Baidu will undertake the naming activity on its Baidu App.

Later, the spacecraft will spend two to three months surveying potential landing sites in preparation for the landing in May. After the landing, the rover will be released to conduct scientific exploration with an expected lifespan of at least 90 Martian days, which is around three months on Earth.
