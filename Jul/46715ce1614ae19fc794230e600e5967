 Fuzhou, capital city of East China's Fujian Province, announced it was entering "wartime mode" after the discovery of an asymptomatic COVID-19 patient from Dalian, where a recent cluster of infections was found. The patient, a construction worker surnamed Chi, was found to have contracted the virus on Saturday. An epidemiological investigation shows that Chi had been to various hospitals, parks and hotels.As of Monday night, all 1,495 direct and indirect contacts of Chi had taken nucleic acid tests, of whom 604 have so far tested negative. Chi's co-workers and close contacts have been put under 14-day home quarantine, and the government has disinfected the construction site where he worked.Fuzhou has since announced it was entering wartime mode. An employee from the city's emergency management bureau told the Global Times on Tuesday that they had announced "wartime mode" to raise people's alertness level. "Anyone who enters the city just has to show their health code, and then people are allowed to move freely. It is just to remind people to stay cautious."The Fuzhou government called for strict "health management measures" to be taken at railway stations, airports and bus stations for people from medium- and high-risk areas from Dalian and Urumqi, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It added that people from those areas who entered Fuzhou after July 5 must be registered and given nucleic acid tests.Infections from Dalian have surged in recent days and reportedly spread to nine other cities, including Beijing, within days. Global Times
