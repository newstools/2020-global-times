A freight train derailed and caught fire on a bridge in Arizona, the US on Wednesday, but there were no reports of injuries in what a witness described as a "scene from hell."The accident near Phoenix took place at around 6:15 am, prompting a massive fire visible for miles and sending some 100 firefighters, police and paramedics to the scene.Tim McMahan, a spokesman for Union Pacific, told AFP that eight to 10 cars caught fire as the train, which was moving freight, crossed a bridge over Tempe Town Lake.He said that the cars that burned for hours were carrying lumber."The south side of the bridge collapsed and rail cars fell into an empty park below," McMahan said, adding that the bridge had undergone inspection earlier in July.McMahan said in a statement that that there were no injuries among the crew but one person was treated for smoke inhalation.AFP
