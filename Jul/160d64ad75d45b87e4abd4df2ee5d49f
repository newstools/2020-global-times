Almost three-quarters of mothers in Britain have been forced to cut work hours because of childcare issues under COVID-19 lockdowns, according to a survey by a maternal rights group which warned more action was needed to protect women's careers.

People gather to listen to speakers at a protest organized by "Keep Britain Free" in London on Sunday, in response to the government's decision to impose mask wearing for shoppers as a precaution against COVID-19.
