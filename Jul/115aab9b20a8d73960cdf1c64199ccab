They were donated by the Chinese government, enterprises and organizations.Addressing Wednesday's event, the prime minister stressed that the aid from donors was critical to fill gaps and secure the means to prevent the further spread of the virus and provide the best possible help to those infected."We knew at the beginning of the crisis that we had a very small number of beds in ICUs," Mitsotakis said.In January, Greece had 5.5 ICU beds per 100,000 people while the European Union (EU) average is 12 ICU beds per 100,000 people, he noted. Currently, Greece has 7 ICU beds per 100,000 people and by 2021, thanks to the new donation, will reach the EU average.

I think that witnessing what has happened in other countries, you all have every reason to be proud because you saved many lives," Mitsotakis stressed.Greek authorities announced on Wednesday that 23 new COVID-19 cases have been registered since Tuesday nationwide, and no fatalities.Greece has now 3,432 confirmed infections, including 192 deaths, since the first case was diagnosed on Feb. 26 in the country.Nine patients were currently hospitalized in ICUs, while 119 people have been discharged from ICUs so far.
