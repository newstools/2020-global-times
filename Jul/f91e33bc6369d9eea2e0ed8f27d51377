It is the most popular tourist destination in Barcelona.The reopening of Sagrada Familia will take place in three separate stages, with the aim of recognizing the efforts of the citizens of Barcelona in the fight against COVID-19.The first phase is named the "Homage Phase." From Saturday, access to the building is given only to healthcare workers, police officers, security and social workers and those who work for charity organizations, as well as those who ensured the supply of vital goods and services during the worst time of the coronavirus crisis.The Homage Phase lasts for a week before the second stage, "Barcelona Time" starts. This stage aims to give other Barcelona residents the opportunity to view the building in the heart of their city for free and without the distraction of tourists.Finally, both national and international tourists will be able to enter the emblematic building at a still-to-be-confirmed date, depending on the evolution of the pandemic over the coming days and weeks.
