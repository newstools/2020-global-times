Hong Kong Photo: VCG China on Tuesday announced the suspension of extradition treaties and agreements on mutual assistance for criminal matters between the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) and Canada, Australia and the UK in response to the three countries’ interference in China’s domestic affairs. The three countries had unilaterally suspended their extradition treaties with HKSAR at an excuse of being concerned over the national security law for HKSAR. The move was blatant interference in China’s internal affairs and seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at Tuesday’s routine press conference. China strongly opposes these moves. HKSAR had been offering legal assistance for criminal matters to Canada, Australia and the UK under the framework of the treaties and agreements, but these countries politicized the judicial cooperation and undermined the cooperation between HKSAR and these countries in this regard, Wang said. The move deviated from the principle of judicial cooperation, safeguarding justice and the rule of law, and China strongly opposes it, Wang said. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
