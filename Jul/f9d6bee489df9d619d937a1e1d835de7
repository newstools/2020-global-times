I feel so bad, so down because of it," Hamoudi, an asylum-seeker from Somalia and resident of the Vial camp on Chios island, told AFP. The 24-year-old said he saw no social distancing in the camp and could not think of any health benefits of the lockdown for the migrants."Maybe they just want to make it a closed camp," he said. "But closed for what?"The camp lockdown has stopped most NGOs from carrying out normal deliveries of clothing, nappies and other necessities. "We can't get adequate aid to people. They are messaging us from inside the camp," said Ruhi Akhtar, a volunteer on Chios who regularly gave out clothes and other provisions before the lockdown.Parwana Ansari, a 16-year-old from Afghanistan who lives in the Vial refugee camp, said people needed to leave the camp just to get the basics. "We need to go to town to go shopping," she said. "The food in Vial is no good."AFP
