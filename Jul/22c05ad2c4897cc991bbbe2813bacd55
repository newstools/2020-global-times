People walk past a banner demanding extension of Brexit transition period outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, on June 10, 2020. Britain will not extend its transitional links to the European Union (EU) beyond Dec. 31, a government minister said Tuesday following the stalled talks between London and Brussels last week.

A spokesman for Johnson said the prime minister was confident the referendum result to leave the EU was fair.The report cast Russia as a hostile power which posed a significant threat to Britain and the West across a range of fronts, from espionage and cyber to election meddling and laundering dirty money."It appears that Russia considers the UK one of its top Western intelligence targets," the report said.It said there were open source indications that Russia had sought to influence the Brexit campaign. But hard evidence had not been produced."The key point is ... they had not sought even to ask that question and that is at the heart of this report," Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National Party member of the committee, told reporters.British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab rejected claims that the government had avoided investigating Russia.Russia has repeatedly denied meddling in the West, casting the US and Britain as gripped by anti-Russian hysteria."Russia has never interfered in the electoral processes of any country in the world - not the United States, not Britain, nor any other countries," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.Reuters
