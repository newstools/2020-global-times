Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee during An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., the United States, on Oct. 23, 2019. (Xinhua/Liu Jie) Holocaust survivors launched a campaign Wednesday in which they plan to upload daily videos to Facebook urging CEO Mark Zuckerberg to remove posts from the site that deny the Nazi genocide of Jews.Survivors from around the globe, including Anne Frank's stepsister, have recorded 30-second messages that are then posted on social media, including Instagram and Twitter, with the hashtag #NoDenyingIt.The online campaign comes as hundreds of advertisers boycotting Facebook as part of a call for them to take more aggressive action against toxic and inflammatory content that promotes violence and hate."I lost all my family. Many, many family members. There is no denying it! Remove Holocaust denial from Facebook," Eva Schloss, Frank's stepsister, says in her video.Other survivors who have contributed to the project include Serge Klarsfeld, a prominent so-called Nazi hunter who has helped track down and expose Nazi war criminals.The campaign has been organized by the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.The nonprofit works to seek compensation from the German government and the return of Jewish property stolen by the Nazis.Zuckerberg, who is Jewish, sparked controversy in 2018 when he argued that Facebook should not filter out posts denying that the Nazis killed 6 million Jews.Â AFP
