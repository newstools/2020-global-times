Australia's competition regulator on Monday accused Alphabet's Google of misleading consumers to get permission for use of their personal data for targeted advertising, seeking a fine "in the millions" and aiming to establish a precedent.

"We allege they've achieved it through misleading behavior."The change allowed Google to link the browsing behavior of millions of consumers with their names and identities, providing it with extreme market power, the regulator added."We consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google," Sims said.However, Google said the change was optional and consumer consent was sought through prominent and easy-to-understand notifications."If a user did not consent, their experience of our products and services remained unchanged," a Google spokesman said in an email, adding that the company intends to defend its position.In June 2016, Google had changed the wording of its privacy policy.
