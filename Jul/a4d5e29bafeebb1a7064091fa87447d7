They are positive role models for children," said Yang.The local education administration's director general, Zhu Zifan said the exam's format was similar to the middle and high school entrance exams which contain readings that focus more on some social issues, the Qianjiang Evening News reported.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
