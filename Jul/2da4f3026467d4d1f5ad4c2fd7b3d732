The US has previously rejected it.The COVID-19 pandemic is a common enemy for all mankind, posing a great challenge to the globe. International cooperation in battling the pandemic testifies to the significance of adhering to multilateralism and international solidarity, which is also the foundation for ensuring the ultimate victory against the pandemic and the building of a community of common destiny. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations and the 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Members of the international community have become increasingly supportive of multilateralism and safeguarding the current international arms control and non-proliferation mechanism, Li pointed out at the conference.Arms control in the new era must be built on the basis of adhering to commitments, completely abandoning the Cold War mentality, and safeguarding common security, he said.Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature,adopted the decision on joining the Arms Trade Treaty on June 20, which shows that the country has completed all the legal procedures at home and will become a member country of the treaty, Li said. The move embodies China's determination and sincerity in supporting multilateralism, and building a community with a shared future for humanity, he noted. "China's participation will also promote the treaty, making it more universal and more effective."Global Times
