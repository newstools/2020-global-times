China Post, the designated operator of UPU in China, strictly abides by such rules by declining postal delivery orders containing seeds.China Post has confirmed that the layout and content of the waybills for these postal packages contain many mistakes and are therefore fake.China Post has been communicating with its US counterparts to ask for these packages to be rerouted to China so that a probe can begin, Wang said.
