For instance, connectors of parts were replaced with titanium to adapt to maritime environments, the company said.The primary tests of the drone provided a good foundation for future experiments, they noted.The standard version of the CH-5 is a medium-to-high altitude long endurance armed reconnaissance drone with a fully automatic flight control system, jam-proof data chain and all-weather payload, according to a separate statement the company sent to the Global Times.With a wing span of 21 meters and a ceiling of 8,300 meters, the standard CH-5 has a maximum endurance of 35 hours, a top speed of 300 kilometers an hour, a maximum takeoff weight of 3,300 kilograms, and a payload weight of 480 kilograms.The standard CH-5 can conduct short takeoff and landing in plateau regions and is easy to use, reliable and cost-effective, the company said, noting that it can be customized with additional equipment, including fire control radar, electronic countermeasures and jamming devices.It also has civilian applications, like airborne geophysical exploration, the statement said.
