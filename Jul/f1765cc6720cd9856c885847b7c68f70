People who finished quarantine wait to get documents before leaving a designated quarantine site in Beijing, capital of China, July 11, 2020. From Saturday, the second batch of people at high risk of exposure to the Xinfadi market are released from quarantine. (Xinhua/Zhang Chenlin)Beijing saw zero newly confirmed COVID-19 cases for the seventh consecutive day on Sunday, with 14 more patients being discharged from hospitals. The Beijing health commission said on Monday that zero new COVID-19 cases, zero suspected or asymptomatic infections were reported on Sunday.From an epidemiological point of view, only when there are no new cases within two incubation periods; that is, 28 days, could it prove there is no virus present, said an expert from Beijing CDC.Since June 11, when the first case connected to the Xinfadi market was reported, Beijing has seen a total of 335 infections, of whom 109 have been cured and discharged from hospitals. Another 226 are still hospitalized and 18 asymptomatic infections are under medial observation. The capital only has one high epidemic risk area left, which is Huaxiang located in Fengtai district. The number of medium-risk regions has been lowered to nine. Anyone around the country holding a green healthy QR code and whose body temperature is normal can enter and exit Beijing, apart from those people from high- and medium-risk regions. Nucleic acid tests are not required.Global Times
