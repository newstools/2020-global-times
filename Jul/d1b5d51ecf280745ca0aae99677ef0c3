But any attack "by the enemy" would be met with force, he added. The truce is only the third official respite in Afghanistan's conflict since the war started in 2001, with other cease-fires in June 2018 and May 2020 to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan.The truces prompted widespread relief across Afghanistan but were short-lived, with the insurgents returning to the battlefields straight afterwards to resume near-daily attacks.The top US diplomat in Kabul, Ross Wilson, welcomed the cease-fire and voiced hope that the two sides would move quickly to the negotiating table."Afghans deserve to celebrate the holiday in peace," he wrote on Twitter.Under the deal signed by the US and the Taliban in February, all foreign forces are supposed to quit Afghanistan in the coming months in return for several insurgent security pledges.The deal also stated the Taliban and Kabul should start direct peace talks on March 10, following the completion of the prisoner swap.
