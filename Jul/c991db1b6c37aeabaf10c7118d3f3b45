And China's manufacturing sector, which is already beginning to recover, will benefit further from that."However, as the coronavirus is still largely uncontained in the US and many of China's other trade partners, the PPI is expected to remain in negative growth in the months to come, Tian said, and exports will see a gradual but slow recovery within the year. China's consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.5 percent year-on-year in June, official data showed on Thursday, picking up from May's 2.4 percent and in line with forecasts. Compared to May, food prices increased 0.2 percent in June, contributing 0.04 percentage points in the CPI rise, said Yao Lijuan, an analyst from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Pork prices rose 3.6 percent in June, and prices of vegetable jumped 2.8 percent due to a short-term supply shortage caused by flooding and Beijing's coronavirus resurgence. "The short-term increase in consumer prices is not likely to stay longer than the month," Tian said. "With supplies of pork and vegetables resuming quickly, the short-term factors will not cause drastic fluctuations in the CPI."Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
