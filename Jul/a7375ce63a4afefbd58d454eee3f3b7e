Photo: XinhuaBeijing's latest COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a virus strain from Europe, and transmitted through multiple exposure methods; for example, contaminated environments and goods, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) said on Friday.The possibility that it may have been transmitted by animals to humans has been ruled out, and the Chinese CDC is currently investigating how the virus entered the market and its spreading mechanism.According to an epidemiological investigation and analysis of viral gene sequencing results, the strain that caused the outbreak is the European branch I of the L genotype.The results of the high-throughput sequencing of the novel coronavirus genome from 52 confirmed cases in Beijing showed that all samples mutated at four sites, compared to the strain in Wuhan, according to Chinese CDC, adding the high-throughput genome-wide sequence of new coronavirus samples from the confirmed cases in North China's Hebei and Tianjin is identical to the genome-wide sequence of Beijing's samples.Chinese CDC also said it initially determined that the large-scale outbreak in Beijing's Xinfadi market was caused by exposure such as environmental pollution, objects, and personnel contact. The epidemic then quickly spread to more districts in Beijing and other provinces, leading to 29 Xinfadi-related outbreaks in other markets, households, and units.The effects of the comprehensive prevention and control measures currently implemented in Beijing as well as other areas have already taken effect, and the risk of continued exposure to the relevant exposed personnel has been basically eliminated, Chinese CDC said."The risk of subsequent new infections is low, and Beijing's outbreak has been effectively controlled," said the center.Beijing reported zero new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, maintaining the record for four consecutive days.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
