We do not have the luxury of time," he said.The announcement marked an acknowledgement of the role young people have been playing in combating climate change as they look to their future.Young climate change activists met with UN leaders in fall of 2019 to demand a greater role in global decision-making and planning processes to combat global warming.The one-day summit at the UN drew more than 1,000 young climate campaigners from more than 120 countries.Guterres, who has made climate change his signature issue since taking office in 2017, said recently that governments should consider the issue when designing economic stimulus responses to the coronavirus pandemic."Where taxpayers' money is used to rescue businesses, it needs to be tied to achieving green jobs and sustainable growth," Guterres said on Earth Day in April.Unable to gather due to coronavirus restrictions, young activists from about 20 countries recently took to YouTube in a 24-hour broadcast to share ideas on how to fight global warming.Previously they were skipping classes, marching through cities and holding vigils outside government buildings in regular Friday protests.The founder of Fridays for Future, Sweden's Greta Thunberg, 17, addressed the UN in 2019.She was not among those named to the advisory group.Â As the world plans its economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, it faces a crossroads - turn towards a greener, more resilient future or tip into a carbon-heavy trap that fails to limit global warming, Yannick Glemarec, executive director of the multibillion dollar Green Climate Fund (GCF) said on Thursday. In its first five years, the GCF has allocated $5.3 billion to 128 projects to cut planet-warming emissions and boost the resilience of more than 350 million people.Newspaper headline: UN chief invites young climate activists to meet, give input, plan processes
