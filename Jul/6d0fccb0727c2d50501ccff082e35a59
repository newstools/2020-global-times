In a sign of technological confidence, the firm announced in March it would open-source its proprietary deep learning framework MegEngine, making the platform accessible to developers across the globe.The 1.0 version of Megvii's Brain++ architecture, built to enable algorithm training at scale, will be officially launched in September, according to Yin, highlighting the firm's temperature screening solution as part of the AI-enabled response to the coronavirus outbreak which is accelerating digitalization. The AI unicorn was founded in 2011 by three Tsinghua University graduates - Yin, Tang Wenbin and Yang Mu. Eight Chinese tech firms including top AI startups such as Megvii, SenseTime Group and YITU Technology were added to the US Entity List in October 2019. An increasing number of Chinese entities were put on the list amid heightened tensions between the world's top two economies. In a fresh move, the US commerce department announced earlier in July the addition of 11 Chinese firms including Nanchang O-Film Tech and Beijing Liuhe BGI to the list.China-origin AI algorithms are fairly on par with, if not better than their global counterparts, Xiang Ligang, director-general of telecom industry association Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The nation's large user base and wide-ranging AI application scenarios underpin its competitiveness in an era where AI usage becomes increasingly prevalent, he said.When asked about Megvii's IPO postponement, Yin remarked that the firm is continuing its steady push for its listing and is awaiting the right timing.Megvii keeps its business healthy and maintains an adequate cash flow, he said, noting that the firm not only wants to go public but hopes for a stable performance after the Hong Kong listing.The firm filed for an IPO in the Hong Kong market in August 2019.
