"I strongly condemn and firmly oppose that.""What needs to be stated is that I have no interest in going to the United States at all, nor do I have any assets there," said Chen, adding that the "sanctions" are just an ugly farce and disgusting, clumsy tricks of US politicians to humiliate themselves.

I am full of confidence in a brighter future of Xinjiang," Chen said.Zhu Hailun said it is an old trick by the United States to interfere in internal affairs of other countries and contain their development under the guise of "human rights." Its ultimate purpose is to serve its own selfish interests."What the United States did is ridiculous and laughable," said Wang Mingshan. "The poor performances of the United States in attacking, smearing, and rumor-mongering over Xinjiang-related affairs will only make the world understand more clearly the hypocrisy and hegemony of the United States.""The United States is the world's biggest human rights violator. Its groundless accusations against Xinjiang are the biggest lies of the century," said Huo Liujun.
