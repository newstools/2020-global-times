We urge some US politicians to correct their attitude and discard prejudice and stop wantonly oppressing Chinese companies," Wang said, adding that these people should do more to promote the China-US relationship instead of the opposite. Wang stressed that China has no interest in and will not interfere in the US election.He said he hopes that US politicians will not make accusations against China in the election.The comment came as a group of Republican US senators such as Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton alleged in a letter to US President Donald Trump that alleged censorship by TikTok of sensitive content may be used by the Chinese government to manipulate political discussions on social media platforms, Reuters reported.
