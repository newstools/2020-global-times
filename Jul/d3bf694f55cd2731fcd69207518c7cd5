It has since fallen to about 30 percent, he added.He also called on companies to encourage staggered shifts and avoid large after-work gatherings for drinks or meals.The rate of telecommuting has lagged in Japan because of a paper-driven culture and technological shortcomings, experts say.Despite the rise in cases, the government does not plan to call another state of emergency, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. "The situation compared to April is very different," he said, citing the small number of serious cases as well as fewer cases among the elderly.On Monday, 131 new cases were confirmed in the capital, Governor Yuriko Koike said, but noted that testing had fallen to about 20 percent of normal over the extended holiday weekend.Newspaper headline: Japan govt to urge more remote work
