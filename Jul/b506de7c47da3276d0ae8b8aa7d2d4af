But on Thursday, National Security Council spokesman Javid Fasial said the Taliban can submit a new list of 592 prisoners."We have given the Taliban the choice to submit to us another 592 names for consideration for release, or we might take matters in our own hands," Faisal wrote on Twitter. "The ball is in the Talib court."The Taliban on Wednesday accused the government of "fabricating" criminal cases against the prisoners the militants want to be freed.Both sides have pledged to hold direct talks aimed at ending the decades-old conflict in Afghanistan after completing the prisoner exchange. Faisal said that the government has already freed 4,019 Taliban inmates.Newspaper headline: Taliban can submit new list of prisoners
