A global goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 will not be met without a huge acceleration in clean energy innovation, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.

The first project of the large-scale PV power station in the Kubuqi Desert in Inner Mongolia has recently joined the national power grid, which is expected to reduce 800,000 tonnes of carbon emissions every year. The Dalad PV Power Base was approved by the National Energy Administration in November 2017.

Whatever we do with renewables will not be enough on their own and it will be all but impossible to meet net zero by 2050," he added.The four most critical clean technologies needing innovation are battery technologies, carbon capture and storage, bioenergy and low-carbon hydrogen, which are currently mostly in the development phase and/or costly.Global CO2 emissions are expected to be 8 percent lower in 2020 than in 2019 - their lowest level since 2010 - as energy demand has slumped due to the coronavirus pandemic, but they are likely to rebound as economies recover unless action is taken.Although there are likely to be less funds available for bringing new technologies to market right now, economic recovery plans being developed by a range of countries provide an opportunity for governments to support clean energy technology progress, the IEA said.Newspaper headline: Carbon footprint goal requires new ideas
