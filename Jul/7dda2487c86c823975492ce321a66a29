In June, some 347 hectares of the desert has been sowed with dry rice as experimental field.

"One mu of dry rice consumes 350 cubic meters of water, while regular rice needs 1,200 cubic meters," he said.Huge potentialAt the lab in Karamay, Peng and his team bred seeds for different regions and climates."It can be planted across the country from South China's Hainan Province to Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, and will play a role in rural revitalization and poverty eradication," Peng told the Global Times.

"Dry rice stalks contain equal nutrition with corn stalks, and stalks of one mu dry rice are able to support five sheep for four months, which is a tidy income for farmers," Peng introduced. Dry rice has been in trial plantation in 16 provincial regions in China that represent various altitudes, landforms and climates, among them, 1,000 hectares are in desert in Inner Mongolia, and 100 hectares in Xinjiang.He said he would like to see dry rice and its planting technology to be spread to other countries that suffer from food shortage once the project is approved by the government as it will not only mitigate food shortage in these countries, but also save water resources.
