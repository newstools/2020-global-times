Photo: AFPThe New York Times cited a so-called study from US climate observers Alan Basist and Claude Williams on April 13 to blame China of limiting the Mekong River's flow that caused the record low water levels in downstream countries.However, Chinese experts carefully evaluated Basist' report and found that both the humidity model and flow model used in the report had serious errors, resulting in unreliable and misleading results.The review also noted the report, called Monitoring the Quantity of Water Flowing Through the Upper Mekong Basin Under Natural (Unimpeded Conditions), was not complied by any authorized academic institution, and was not published by any official or peer-reviewed publication.Moreover, Chinese researchers found the original report's use of humidity as a representation for water flow was academically problematic. There may be a correlation between the data of station water level quoted by the original report's author and the watershed moisture age, but this correlation is not necessarily causal, so the correlation may be unstable.Chinese reviewers suggest the water levels at the sites US observers tested may be correlated with local catchment levels, and not necessarily cause-and-effect.

In response to a request from the Vietnamese government to increase the flow of water downstream to alleviate the drought, China's Jinghong hydropower station at Lancang River immediately released water to downstream countries.Chinese stations along the Lancang River provided 2.7 billion cubic meters of water downstream in 2016, largely alleviating the serious drought.
