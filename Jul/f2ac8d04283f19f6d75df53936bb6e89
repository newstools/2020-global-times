The six-wheeled robot, which is about the size of an SUV and weighs 1,040 kilograms, is NASA's fifth Mars rover and its most advanced to date. It comes equipped with a small helicopter called Ingenuity that will attempt to fly - a first on another planet - as well as a robotic arm, and an array of cameras and a pair of microphones.To look for evidence of ancient fossilized bacteria, it will use two lasers and an X-ray capable of chemical analysis. It will gather rock and soil samples for a future mission that will bring them back to Earth.Newspaper headline: Mars rover ‘go for launch,’ says NASA
