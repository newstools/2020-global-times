A man in Southwest China's Yunnan Province was executed on Thursday for murdering two COVID-19 prevention personnel who tried to stop him from disrupting traffic control measures in February. 
The murder took place in a village in Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan, on February 6, leading to widespread outrage from the public at a time when the epidemic situation in China was severe and the whole country had implemented strict measures to prevent and control the virus.
The 24-year-old man, Ma Jianguo, stabbed one person with a folding knife at a prevention checkpoint in the village as the checkpoint personnel tried to stop him from removing the barricades that blocked his car and filmed his action with a mobile phone. 
The second person was killed after coming to the aid of his co-worker. 
Ma was sentenced to death for intentional homicide by Honghe Intermediate People's Court on March 1. 
Ma had previously been in prison for intentional injury. The murder took place after the completion of his previous five-year sentence, according to an announcement the Supreme People's Court of China published on Thursday.
