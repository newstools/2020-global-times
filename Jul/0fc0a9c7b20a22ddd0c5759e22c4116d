Its director Bong Joon-ho was already an Academy member.The board of governors vowed four years ago to double the number of women and non-white members by 2020, following calls to boycott the glitzy Oscars and an angry social media backlash under the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite.The move toward racial equality in Hollywood has come under further scrutiny in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, which spurred massive nationwide protests under the banner of "Black Lives Matter."Movie studios and stars have flocked to express their support for the movement, from public statements and inclusion initiatives to the removal of TV episodes featuring "blackface" and warnings over outdated titles such as Gone with the Wind.The Academy has now surpassed its membership goals, with 45 percent of 2020's intake women, and 36 percent minorities. Achieving those targets has drastically boosted the overall size of the Academy membership, which was traditionally capped at around 6,000 members.Tuesday's intake of 819 sees the body approach 10,000 members, though the number of invitees is slightly down from the record numbers of the past two years.Newspaper headline: Boosting diversity
