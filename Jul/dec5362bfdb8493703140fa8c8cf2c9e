Photo: AFPBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has again tested positive for the novel coronavirus, his office announced Wednesday, saying that he would extend his two-week quarantine and suspend upcoming travel plans.The far-right leader, who has faced criticism for downplaying the pandemic and flouting social distancing measures, has been in self-isolation in the presidential palace in Brasilia since first testing positive for the virus on July 7."President Jair Bolsonaro's health continues to improve, under the treatment of the presidential medical team," his office said in a statement."A [new coronavirus] test carried out yesterday on the president came back positive."Bolsonaro, 65, has famously compared the virus to a "little flu" and attacked stay-at-home measures and other guidelines from public-health officials.Until he was infected, he regularly hit the streets of Brasilia without a face mask, exchanging hugs and handshakes with supporters and urging Latin America's biggest country to get back to work despite its rapidly spreading outbreak.Since testing positive after developing a fever and fatigue, he has been working by video conference from the presidential residence - a routine he admitted last week he "can't stand."Following the latest positive test result, his third since getting infected, Bolsonaro "indefinitely postponed" upcoming trips to the northeastern states of Piaui and Bahia, his office told AFP.AFP
