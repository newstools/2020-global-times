It has brought people, communities and nations together, and driven them apart," Tedros said.The WHO has faced criticism from certain quarters for its response, with some charging it acted too slowly - something the organization itself strenuously denies."Over the past six months, WHO has worked tirelessly to support countries to prepare for and respond to this virus," Tedros said.Earlier in July, US President Donald Trump made good on his threat to begin withdrawing the US - traditionally WHO's largest donor - from the organization.As of Monday evening, the US, the worst-hit nation in the world, had added another 57,000 cases of infection and its recorded death toll stood at 147,588, said Johns Hopkins University.Officials around the world reintroduced a raft of restrictions Monday to try to tamp down coronavirus hot spots as the official global death toll passed 650,000.European countries trying to repair the economic damage caused by the earlier lockdowns struggled to balance keeping the lifeline of tourism open while guarding against new flare-ups of infection.Spain's tourism industry faced fresh misery after British travelers canceled flights there following London's decision to reintroduce quarantine for travelers returning from the country.AFP
