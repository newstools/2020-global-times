Chicago has suffered about 1,640 shootings and 414 murders in 2020, according to police data.Both figures are up around 50 percent from 2019. Officials blame frustration and economic pains from the COVID-19 crisis, stepped gang rivalries, and easy access to guns. New York shootings are also running at their highest levels in over a decade, and many other urban areas are facing similar challenges.Shootings have accelerated during the summer across the country. More than 60 people were shot in Chicago, including 14 fatalities, over the past weekend alone.AFP
