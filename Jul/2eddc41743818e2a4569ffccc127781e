Yemeni workers collect rubbish piled up on the streets as garbage trucks hardly run due to an acute shortage of fuel in the capital Sanaa, on Monday. A fuel shortage is blighting life in the swathes of Yemen controlled by Huthi rebels, cutting electricity supplies and halting water pumps as warring sides trade blame.
