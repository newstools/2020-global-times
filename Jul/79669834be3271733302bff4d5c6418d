He is currently president of the UK's Supreme Court.The judges include non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal from common law jurisdictions whose immense contribution to HKSAR has also been acknowledged by the HKSAR government, and this point has already been made by the Chief Justice of Court of Final Appeal on July 2, the spokesperson said. Currently, the Court of Final Appeal has 14 non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions, of whom nine are from the UK, four are from Australia and one is from Canada. "The independence of the legal system and rule of law are fundamentals of Hong Kong society, which is also protected by the Basic Law," the spokesperson said. Although the Chief Justice of Court of Final Appeal said that judges of foreign nationality will not be excluded as the national security law for Hong Kong comes into effect, some local legal experts pointed out that Hong Kong's legal system and judiciary have always adhered to the principle that conflict of interests should be avoided. Judges who have dual nationality or have made a pledge to another country are not fit to hear national security cases, according to some legal experts. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
