Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, holds a routine press conference.  China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China is considering not recognizing British National (Overseas) passports as a viable travel document after the UK released more information on the new Hong Kong BNO visa that allows their holders to move to the country for residency.Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on Thursday that China firmly opposes the UK's move that interferes in Hong Kong's affairs and China's internal affairs, will consider not recognizing the BNO passport as a viable travel document, and reserve the rights to further take action. The remark came after the UK on Wednesday released more information on the new Hong Kong BNO Visa, which will create a bespoke immigration route to enable Hong Kong residents holding the BNO and their immediate family members to move to the UK to work and study, the UK government said on its official website.The Hong Kong BNO Visa route will open from January 2021, said the UK government.The spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK said on Thursday, "In an MOU exchanged between China and the UK, the UK has explicitly pledged that BNO passport holders who are Chinese citizens residing in Hong Kong shall not have the right of abode in the UK."However, the UK has now, in total disregard of the strong opposition and repeated representations of the Chinese side, which seriously goes against its own promises, interfered in China's internal affairs, and violated international law and the basic norms governing international relations. "The Chinese side expresses its grave concern and strong opposition, and will certainly take effective countermeasures," said the embassy spokesperson.The spokesperson noted that the Chinese side urges the UK side to recognize the fact that Hong Kong is part of China, have a right and objective understanding on the national security law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, immediately correct its mistakes and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs, in any form. Such interference will be self-defeating, said the embassy. Global Times
