Poland would be one of those other places," he said.Trump said earlier in June that he was cutting troops due to unhappiness with Germany.On June 15, two weeks after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that she would not attend a Trump-planned G7 summit because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump complained Berlin is not spending enough on its own defense and treats the US "badly" on trade."We're negotiating with them on that, but right now I'm not satisfied with the deal they want to make. They've cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars over the years on trade, so we get hurt on trade and we get hurt on NATO," said Trump."It's a tremendous cost to the United States," he said. "So we're removing a number down to, we're putting the number down to 25,000 soldiers."AFP
