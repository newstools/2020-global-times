Indian Navy warships held a joint exercise with the United States Navy in the Indian Ocean on Monday.A day after the US House of Representatives slammed China’s “aggression against India” in the Galwan Valley, US supercarrier USS Ronald Reagan on Tuesday carried out a joint exercise with two QUAD members — Australia and Japan — in the Philippine Sea.Those moves suggested that the US is intending to collude with other countries, to contain China, said Song, who predicted Japan, Australia and the UK will become important US “accomplices.” Japan may be harboring concerns, but the UK and Australia will firmly support the US because of issues such like Hong Kong, according to Song. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) will definitely take equivalent countermeasures against US constant provocations in the region, adding to the possibility of military skirmishes, said Song.He noted that the US is only looking to provoke  before the presidential election, and has no intention to make a military conflict, which is not doing any good for the US election.  “At the same time, the PLA will also keep their hair on.”Previous media reports said that India is favorably considering Australia's keen interest to be part of the next edition of the Malabar naval exercise which is scheduled to be held later this year.Qian Feng, director of the research department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told the Global Times that even if Australia were to join drills this year, it does not mean that it has officially become a member of Malabar.Granting Australia membership needs further observation but if the country becomes a member, it will be an unfavorable turn for China, said Qian. “Once the US manages to pull India, Japan and Australia to form a quadrilateral accord, its goal of containing China becomes more obvious,” said Qian.
