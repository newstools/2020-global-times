Tiger populations in five countries are making a comeback but the endangered species still faces major threats such as poaching, conservation group WWF and the Indian government said.

But many of the corridor habitats were not protected areas and also at risk due to human activity and development, it said.The census, carried out in 2018-19 at more than 28,000 locations, was also included in the Guinness World Records earlier in July for being the largest-ever camera-trap wildlife survey.
