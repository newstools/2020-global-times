Trucks loaded with containers leave the US consulate in Chengdu on Sunday night. Photo: Cui Meng/GTThe US Consulate General in Chengdu was officially closed at 10 am on Monday, as required by the Chinese side.  China's competent authorities then entered through the front entrance and took over the premises, China's foreign ministry said Monday. The closure of the US consulate has led to layoff of some Chinese employees. However, the Global Times has learnt that some Chinese employees were not properly compensated in accordance with laws and regulations after a sudden layoff.Before the closure, strict traffic controls have been put in place around the premises. The Global Times reporter in the early morning saw cranes hoisting containers inside the main entrance of the US Consulate, while crowds gathered to witness the "historic" moment, taking photos and recording videos. Since Saturday, people and vehicles were frequently seen going in and out of the consulate and locals have quietly gathered behind the police cordon in front of the main gate of the Consulate. Since the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday notified the US Embassy in China that it had decided to revoke permission for the operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, no irrational behavior has been seen in front of the Consulate. However, at one point on Saturday, one person sang The Grand China but was taken away immediately, while another person set off firecrackers outside the Consulate on Friday.Newspaper headline: China takes over premises after closure of US Consulate General in Chengdu
