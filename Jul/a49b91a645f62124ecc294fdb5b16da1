The first Arab space mission to Mars, an unmanned probe dubbed Hope, blasted off from Japan on Monday, in a bid to reveal more about the atmosphere of the Red Planet.

The UAE also wants the project to serve as a source of inspiration for Arab youth.On Twitter, the UAE's government declared the probe launch a "message of pride, hope and peace to the Arab region, in which we renew the golden age of Arab and Islamic discoveries." The Hope probe will offer a special perspective on Mars.Newspaper headline: ‘Hope’ rockets toward Red Planet
