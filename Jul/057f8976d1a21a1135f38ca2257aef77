Officials last blocked movement between the two states in 1919 during the Spanish flu pandemic."It is the smart call, the right call at this time, given the significant challenges we face in containing this virus," Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.The move will, however, likely be a blow to Australia's economic recovery as it heads into its first recession in nearly three decades. The number of COVID-19 cases in the Victorian capital of Melbourne has surged in recent days, prompting authorities to enforce strict social-distancing orders in 30 suburbs and put nine public housing towers into complete lockdown.The state reported 127 new COVID-19 infections overnight, its biggest one-day spike since the pandemic began. It also reported two deaths, the first nationally in more than two weeks, taking the national tally to 106.NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said there was no timetable for reopening the border, which will be patrolled by the military to prevent illegal crossings from 11:59 pm local time on Tuesday.The state line is highly porous, with 55 roads, wilderness parks and rivers. Some businesses straddle both sides and several workers, and school children, commute daily.Lyn McKenzie, who runs a paddle steamer business along the Murray River from Mildura, a border city of 30,000 people, is waiting for more details to gauge the full impact on her business. McKenzie lives on the NSW side of the river, the boats pick up passengers from the Victoria side and the river itself is classified as part of NSW."I'm seeing this as possibly needing to shut down again, but it's a bit early for me, not knowing the exact details," McKenzie told Reuters.Berejiklian said people would be able to apply for daily permits to cross the border, but added there would be delays of around three days in issuing the passes.Paul Armstrong, who runs a petrol station in Wodonga, a border town on the Victorian side, said his children live in NSW but go to school in Victoria. "I wonder if they will need permits," Armstrong said.
