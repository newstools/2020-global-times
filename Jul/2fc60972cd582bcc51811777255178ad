They shall be subject to the supervision of national supervisory authorities in accordance with the law," the national security law for Hong Kong stipulates.Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong affairs at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Thursday that the committee chaired by the chief executive is a decision-making and policy-making body on national security affairs of the HKSAR government, while the central government's national security office is an intelligence and law enforcement agency. According to the law, the office staff shall be dispatched by relevant national security authorities under the central people's government. Observers noted that the staff could mainly come from the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS).Coordination in HKAccording to the law, the new law shall strengthen working relations and cooperation with the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR, and the Hong Kong Garrison of the Chinese PLA.Observers said the new office will fill the gap of safeguarding national security in the HKSAR and will make the central government's governance over the city more mature and comprehensive.Some Hong Kong media outlets predicted that the head of the office would likely be a vice minister from the MPS.Tian said the three offices and the PLA garrison are not subject to each other, but will all be led by the central government, so their relationship would be coordinative and cooperative in nature, and they will work together in information sharing, research and analysis over specific threats or situations.Li Xiaobing said, "Foreign affairs, national defense and national security are in the hands of the central government, and cooperation among these three central government offices in the HKSAR as well as the PLA garrison would be a nightmare for foreign forces."That's why some politicians and officials of Western countries, especially the US, are getting nervous, and Western media and some local Hong Kong media keep hyping the criticism of the law by saying that the central government is killing the "one country, two systems" and undermining the judicial independence of the HKSAR, Li noted.Tian said criticism from Western politicians and some media outlets are boring as they have nothing new to say.Most Hong Kong residents, as well as local and foreign elites doing business in the city, such as the real estate tycoons and foreign banks, do not share this criticism. They even welcome the law as it can create a stable environment for economic recovery, Tian said.Those who are getting nervous or being groundlessly critical of the law know that they have done or are doing something that could be punishable by the new law, and some of them might not be able to think independently because of their biased and senseless mind-set. "No need to refute them again and again," Tian said, "It's just wasting time."
