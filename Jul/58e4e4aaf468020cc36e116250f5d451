SHENYANG, April 1, 2016 (Xinhua) -- Korean War veterans attend a burial ceremony for Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) soldiers who died in the Korean War in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, April 1, 2016. (Xinhua/Yang Qi)China on Thursday announced that it will issue commemorative medals on the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War (1950-53) against the US.The announcement came amid the increasing US containment measures against China in fields including trade, high-tech, national security and military. Analysts said the move shows China's confidence and determination in facing US' aggressions.The special medals will be jointly issued by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, State Council and Central Military Commission, and will be awarded to living Volunteer Army veterans who had fought in the war, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday.Those who contributed to the war against the US, including medical personnel, railway and transportation personnel, interpreters, those involved in armistice negotiations, militias, workers, journalists, writers and photographers, as well as those who had helped North Korea with its resumption of production and construction from the armistice in July 1953 to the withdrawal of all Volunteer Army troops in October 1958, are also eligible to receive the medals.Those who were eligible but passed away after January 1, 2020 will still be included in the medal issuance, reports said.Qualifying personnel should automatically receive the medals, and as a supplementary measure, individuals can also apply for one in the case he or she does not receive one as they should, according to the report.The medals will be issued starting from October.Â China lays huge importance on commemorating the Korean War, analysts noted.China and North Korea are renovating six cemeteries in North Korea to commemorate Chinese People's Volunteer Army martyrs who died in the war, the Chinese Embassy in North Korea announced in October 2019.China also frequently organized the return of remains of Volunteer Army soldiers from South Korea in past years, as aircraft including military transport planes and fighter jets carried and escorted them back to China and burial ceremonies were held.The Chinese Volunteer Army fought side by side with the North Korean army in the Korean War against the South Korean army and US-led UN forces between 1950 and 1953.The Chinese soldiers fought vigorously against the US troops, forced a truce and were reckoned by the US military as formidable opponents. This spirit is particularly important now as the US is again trying to contain China's development and China is still confident and determined in breaking US' aggressions, analysts said.Global Times
