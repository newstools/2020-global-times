"Other foreign financial institutions will follow suit."In wake of the Huawei ban last week, Chinese officials have vowed to take "all necessary" measures to protect Chinese businesses. Though there still has been no countermeasures announced, the dramatic turn of events has sent chilling waves through UK businesses over possible retaliation. Some Chinese experts have warned that certain UK businesses could get caught in the diplomatic crossfire, particularly UK bank HSBC, which has been bombarded for its role in helping US crack down on Huawei.Still, analysts argue that foreign companies like Standard Chartered's move into the Greater Bay Area because of the massive potential for business in the region, given the slew of policy support offered by the Chinese government, and China's commitment to further open up its domestic market for foreign investors. "The future development of the Greater Bay Area is promising because it is an important region for high-quality growth in China and its development is in line with the government's spirit to boost economic growth in the region," Ding Li, director of the Regional and Enterprise Competitiveness Research Center at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.In May, China released a guideline for financial reform and innovation in the Greater Bay Area, including expanding the opening-up for foreign financial institutions. "Especially under the current anti-globalization tide, China will continue to expand and accelerate financial opening regardless of the relationship with the US or the UK… under this backdrop and with the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong, more foreign companies will continue to invest in the Greater Bay Area," Liang said.
