The Global Times noticed that his Weibo profile photo has been removed as of press time and there are only two posts left. It is not clear whether he might close the Weibo account amid the border tensions. India on Monday banned 59 apps with Chinese links, including the popular TikTok and Tencent's WeChat, claiming that "they are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India, the defense of India, the security of the state and public order."The Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed concerns over India's decision on Tuesday. In a daily press briefing, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China is verifying the situation.India has a responsibility to uphold the rights of Chinese businesses. Damaging the win-win cooperation between the two countries isn't in India's own interests, Zhao noted.
