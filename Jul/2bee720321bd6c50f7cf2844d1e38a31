In addition, according to a Reuters report, Telecom Italia (TIM) has excluded Huawei from a tender for 5G equipment for the core network it is preparing to build in Italy and Brazil, citing two sources familiar with the matter.The Chinese 5G frontrunner remains in troubled water in Europe under a recently intensified US crackdown, as many countries are reportedly reconsidering or scaling down cooperation with the firm despite its technology advancements and price advantage.The UK is reconsidering its decision to allow Huawei access to parts of its construction, saying it could phase out use of the firm's technology as soon as this year. The UK decided in January to let Huawei continue its role in the country's 5G network, but with restrictions, despite pressure from the US to crack down on the Chinese firm.Germany and France are also reportedly reassessing the role of the company.Deutsche Telekom (DT), a leading telecoms carrier in Europe, denied reports saying it had enhanced cooperation with Huawei, clarifying that it had scaled down cooperation with the Chinese supplier.Experts have warned that it wouldn't be smart for European countries to reverse their policies on Huawei as local telecoms operators could bear huge extra cost and delays in their 5G construction.China and Europe have long been conducting close cooperation in telecommunications so the two could establish their places in the industry, and the UK and other European countries should think twice before choosing to give up Europe's 5G lead due to US disruption, veteran industry analyst Ma Jihua told the Global Times.Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
