This is to allow Malians to properly prepare for and celebrate Eid.""During this period, there will be no more demonstrations. And as you also know, we are preparing to host the heads of state," he said.The Muslim Eid al-Adha festival of animal sacrifice will begin at the end of July and lasts for several days.Issa Kaou Djim, another protest movement figure, said the truce was a "very responsible and wise decision."But the opposition did not soften its demands, issuing a statement on Monday evening that again called for the resignation of Keita.Thursday's talks follow on the heels of a mediation mission from the West Africa bloc ECOWAS, which ended Sunday after failing to reconcile the president with the opposition.Among other grievances, many Malians are incensed at the outcome of long-delayed parliamentary elections in March and April that handed victory to Keita's party. But the current crisis came to a head on July 10, after an anti-Keita rally organized by the June 5 Movement turned violent.Three days of clashes between protesters and security forces followed, leaving 11 dead and 158 injured, according to an official tally, in the worst political unrest Mali had seen in years. AFP
