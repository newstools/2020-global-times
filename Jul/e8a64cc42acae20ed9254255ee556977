Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on COVID-19: Update on Progress Toward Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School in Washington, D.C., the United States, on June 30, 2020. (Al Drago/Pool via Xinhua)Chinese netizens were shocked to learn that US infectious disease chief Anthony Fauci had been maliciously accused of manufacturing and spreading coronavirus, and showed their sympathy for him after comparing him with Zhong Nanshan, China's top health expert, who is respected all over the country, with one expert noting that politicizing COVID-19 will not help the US overcome the pandemic."The severity of the current pandemic in the US is inseparable from the attitude of the US President Donald Trump's administration toward health experts and science," Yu Wanli, an expert on American studeis, told the Global Times on Monday. The US has become the country worst hit by coronavirus, with more than 4.3 million diagnosed cases and at least 149,849 deaths as of Monday, data showed."The government's distrust of Fauci's scientific advice has been a bad example for the American people, and itwhich will inevitably lead to many Americans not following virus control and prevention guidance," said Yu.The Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) said Saturday it will postpone and rework a segment it planned to air this weekend that suggested Fauci was responsible for the creation of the coronavirus, CNN reported on Sunday.According to the report, in the episode of the show that was set to air, a medical researcher called Judy Mikovits said in the segment that over the past decade, Fauci had "manufactured" and shipped coronaviruse to Wuhan. On top of the accusation, Fauci also said last week that he and his family were receiving hate mail and "serious threats" from people angry over his advice on the pandemic, CNBC reported."Trump's arrogance and lack of common sense during the fight against the pandemic showed that he always puts his political self-interest first. Everything is for the purpose of the upcoming election," said Yu."Trump is afraid that Fauci's advice, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, avoiding politicizing the virus, may affect his presidential election, as his administration didn't prepare well for the pandemic due to underestimating COVID-19 in the early stages of the outbreak, and it has been scapegoating China for his failed anti-pandemic measures, and politicizing coronavirus as the 'China virus' or 'kung flu,'" Yu said."Therefore, the Trump administration abused its power by attacking Fauci and gave up its responsibility of leadership, which is to fight for its people," Yu noted, adding that politicizing COVID-19 will not help the US overcome the pandemic.Fauci has become one of the most trusted and recognizable infectious disease experts in theUS. Known for his candid advice, Fauci has often opposed Trump by recommending school closures, state lockdowns and the use of face masks in public areas where social distancing isn't possible, said CNBC. In the past, Trump and other White House officials have criticized Fauci's advice on COVID-19. In an interview with CNN commentator David Axelrod, Fauci said the attacks are a reflection of the "divisiveness of our society at [the] political level." He asserted that the coronavirus pandemic is a public health issue that should not be politicized.The US' senior health expert's encounter drew the attention of a lot of Chinese internet users. Many netizens felt shocked and confused at the same time, with some even comparing Fauci with Zhong Nanshan."I don't understand why he has been treated so badly in the US and why people don't just follow his suggestions? Isn't his advice the most precious at this critical time when the coronavirus pandemic is rampaging around the US?" one netizen commented."China's Fauci -, Zhong Nanshan, is a household name in China and is well respected nationwide. I am so fortunate to live in a country where health workers are cherished and respected, and science is trusted," said another.Zhong, who is also an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), is the head of the high-level expert team that was put together and sent to Wuhan by China's National Health Commission (NHC) to guide epidemic response and conduct on-site investigations, according to People's Daily.In 2003, Zhong took part in the country's fight against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and became a "SARS hero."
