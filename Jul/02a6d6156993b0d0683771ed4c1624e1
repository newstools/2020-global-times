"If anything, they [Chinese local authorities] have assisted me throughout the COVID-19 period. So I have to thank them," Jack said."I believe that only people who have something to hide, or have broken laws in China should be concerned about detention," Jack said. "I can understand the concerns from the Australian government about its citizens' safety due to previous detentions of its own nationals, and also the cases regarding the two Canadians. But such people have obviously broken laws in China and this goes for any nation in the world, either liberal democratic in nature or not," he said.He said that much of the mistrust of China in academic, media and policy circles in Australia is a misjudgment on their part."Australia's and China's legal systems differ significantly and that can cause anxiety from the Australian side, especially from policymakers and analysts who have little first-hand experience dealing with or living in China," Jack said.The China-Australia relationship is currently at its lowest point in the past two decades.Australian media outlet Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Tuesday that Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Chinese government authorities have detained foreigners because they were allegedly "endangering national security".The department has already advised travelers not to travel to China — or anywhere overseas — because of the coronavirus pandemic.China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued a travel alert on June 5, warning people not to travel to Australia, as the country has seen a significant rising trend of racial discrimination and violence against Chinese and other Asian people due to the pandemic.China's Ministry of Education issued an alert on June 9 to Chinese students who are about to study, or prepare to return to Australia for their studies.
