Photo: AFPThe US marked a grim milestone Wednesday when its coronavirus deaths topped 150,000 - far exceeding the toll in any other pandemic-hit nation.Brazil is second to the US in terms of cases and fatalities, and also reported a sobering figure as it surpassed 90,000 deaths.Nations around the globe, even those that believed they had largely curbed the disease, are seeing a rise in cases that are damaging economies and forcing protection measures that have disrupted all aspects of life.The sacred hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia has begun with some 10,000 Muslim faithful allowed, instead of the roughly 2.5 million that attended in 2019.Pilgrims were brought in small groups into Mecca's Grand Mosque, walking along paths marked on the floor, in sharp contrast to the normal sea of humanity that swirls inside its walls.Even with efforts in place to contain the virus, COVID-19 has killed more than 661,000 people around the world and total infections are approaching 17 million. On Wednesday, the US alone recorded 1,267 new deaths with coronavirus in the past 24 hours and notched more than 68,000 new daily cases, with southern and western states particularly hard-hit.Several countries in Europe have slapped restrictions on travel to and from Spain, while officials in Europe ramp up a spat over the seriousness of the current outbreak. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh from announcing quarantine for travelers returning from Spain, suggested the rest of Europe could be facing a second wave - despite his own country's dismal figures.France's Health Minister Olivier Veran hit back on Wednesday, saying his country was categorically not in a second wave. "Clusters are emerging, we have warning signs from certain hospitals that have seen a trend of increasing admission," Veran said, adding: "We are testing a lot more." Spain insists it is a safe destination and was critical of Britain's blanket quarantine, which includes islands without significant outbreaks.Brazil also wants visitors back, and on Wednesday reopened travel to foreigners arriving by plane, hoping to revive its lockdown-devastated tourism industry.AFP
