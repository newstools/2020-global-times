Meanwhile, the government policy continues to support opening-up, sending out encouraging message to global investors who want to expand their business overseas," Wang said.Wang predicated more foreign banks will come to China in the second half of the year.However, analysts warned the investment will not drag the UK-based lender out from a declining reputation in the China market due to a series of misdeeds and a swaying stance over some key issues, including its "accomplice" role in the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada.HSBC could be the very first British company to be "targeted" amid strained China-UK ties over harming Huawei, analysts warned.British government followed the Trump administration's instructions in banning Huawei's 5G equipment last week, even though London argued strongly that the decision had nothing to do with the US.
