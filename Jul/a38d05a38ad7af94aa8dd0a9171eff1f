The country's law enforcement officials have used tear gas, rubber bullets, beatings, solitary confinement and a total ban on family and lawyers for detained migrants on a hunger strike.The Chinese side urged the country to pay more attention to the rights of migrants to life, work, health, education and dignity, and stop the policy measures that violate human rights and take credible steps to combat racism, discrimination, populism, hate speech and xenophobia.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
