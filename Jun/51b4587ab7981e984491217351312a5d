Hungary is set to revoke Tuesday anti-coronavirus emergency powers that triggered international criticism amid fears of a power grab by Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

But critics at home and abroad who fretted that the law had no time limit and was vulnerable to abuse accused Orban of using the crisis to steer EU member Hungary toward authoritarianism.In April, the European Parliament approved a statement saying Hungary's measures were "incompatible with European values."Governments that used the crisis to mount executive power grabs would be "politically dangerous, and morally unacceptable," said Donald Tusk, leader of Europe's EPP conservative political grouping, which Fidesz also belongs to.Budapest dismissed the criticism as "fake news" and said the legislation was proportionate and could be rescinded at any time by parliament or reviewed by the constitutional court.Previously when looking forward to the end of emergency powers, Orban has said that critics "will get a chance to apologize to Hungary for unfounded accusations about the law."Hungarian opposition parties and rights groups at home and abroad called the extra powers "dictatorial" and said Orban abused them to cement his rule rather than combat the virus.Some of the more than 100 decrees issued since April stripped opposition-run municipalities of power and finances.Newspaper headline: Hungary set to end disputed emergency anti-coronavirus powers
