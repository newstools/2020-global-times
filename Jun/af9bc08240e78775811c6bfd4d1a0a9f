white pape press Photo: GT  China on Sunday published a white paper outlining its detailed steps and measures in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic, which serves as a demonstration to the world on how China won the arduous fight.  It also shows how China has timely and effectively curbed the viral spread, bearing no procrastination, delivering a strong rebuke to foreign media and politicians' rancorous accusations of China on alleged "cover-up" and "delay" in its response.The White Paper on fighting COVID-19: China in Action was issued to record the Chinese people's battle against the virus; to share with the international community China's experience of curbing the virus; and to make clear China's stance in fighting the virus.As of May 31, China reported a total of 83,017 confirmed COVID-19 patients, among which 78,307 were discharged from hospital with 4,634 deaths, which makes the country's mortality rate 5.6 percent, read a white paper issued by the State Council Information Office on Sunday.On Thursday, China's hardest-hit Hubei Province accomplished seven "zeros": zero new COVID-19 cases, zero new suspected cases, zero new deaths, zero silent carriers, zero imported cases, zero existing confirmed cases and zero existing suspected cases, the provincial health official said.The whole country was alerted and actively participated in the viral battle, which included a historical lockdown of 60 million people in Hubei Province, the region hit hardest by the virus; and 1.4 billion people voluntarily protecting themselves by cooperating with the government's viral prevention measures, Wang Guangfa, a respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital, told the Global Times. "This is why China was able to contain the virus within five months," Wang said. The publication of the white paper, will also act as China's rebuttal to foreign media, such as the Associated Press, Wall Street Journal and BBC, along with foreign politicians, including US President Donald Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's reckless accusations that China has been covering up the viral spread and slowing the response so that the virus could ravage the rest of the world.

A latest rumor that stirred public opinion was an article from the Associated Press, which said China's delay in information sharing irked the WHO.China informed the WHO about the outbreak updates.China notified the WHO about the outbreak updates on January 5, one day after it warned the US, and it shared the preliminary research of the virus' etiology to the WHO on January 9. Ever since January 11, China has kept notifying the WHO on a daily basis, and on January 12, China shared with the WHO about information on the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus.Moreover, China has translated its treatment methodology of coronavirus into three languages, distributed it to 180 countries and regions; and Chinese doctors have conducted constant exchanges with their international counterparts, according to the white paper.Head of the China CDC talked over phone with director of the US CDC about the pneumonia outbreak on January 4. The two sides agreed to keep in close contact for information sharing and technological cooperation. The US was among the first nations to suspend flights to and from China in late January. Trump used to praise China's effective and transparent manner in dealing with the virus; but the attitude of other US politicians' and his own suddenly changed after the US was ravaged by virus.Now the US has recorded more infections and deaths than any other country in the world."They believed they would be fine by cutting all possible connections with China and rest easy, but the US had missed the golden window of opportunity which had cost China a lot to fight for, and procrastinated in their response to the virus," Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.According to the white paper, apart from the WHO, China's exchanges with the US on viral information was more frequent than any other country. It also invited 25 experts from the WHO, the US, Germany and other countries to conduct field investigations in Wuhan, Beijing, Chengdu and other Chinese cities from February 16.

(Xinhua/Xiao Yijiu) Hard-won battleOn January 22, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave important instructions that Wuhan and other places in Hubei Province enforce strict restrictions on the movement of people and outbound travel, said the white paper.After the instruction was issued, 346 national medical teams and 42,600 medical workers had been dispatched to Hubei and Wuhan to help since January 24, which was dubbed as "the biggest medical aid operation since the establishment of the People's Republic of China; later on February 10, 19 other Chinese provinces and autonomous regions were assigned to help 16 other Hubei cities.Through the efforts and solidarity of the whole nation, the rest of China, except Hubei, saw ten days of decline in new infections on February 14; on March 11, new local confirmed cases nationwide slowed to one digit numbers.Hospitals in Wuhan received a total of over 9,600 cases in critical condition, and the cure rate increased from 14 percent to 89 percent; for those who suffered from underlying diseases, medical workers made specific plans for everyone, once there is hope, they never gave up, reads the white paper.By comparison, a cohort published in May in The Lancet saying that of 257 critically ill New York City residents treated at two Manhattan hospitals, 39 percent died.After Wuhan was sealed off in early April, China used only one incubation period to see new infections reach a tipping point, thanks to the Chinese people's cooperation with the government and providing assistance nationwide to help Wuhan and Hubei, said Wang.Wang said he had talked to Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist who led the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 in February while the latter was researching in Wuhan. "He and other WHO experts were holding an objective view but tinted with little suspicion regarding China before they came… Mr. Aylward asked if we deliberately showed him the well-equipped hospitals when we showed him the designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. But we told him that those designated hospitals were newly-built and well-equipped."Aylward said at a news conference in Geneva on Feb 26 that China had been investing massively on disease control and treatment that is even unreachable for Europe.He stunned skeptics on China's resources to treat patients by saying he would want to be treated in China if he caught the virus.
