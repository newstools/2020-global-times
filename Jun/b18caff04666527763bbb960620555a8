And for the high-end healthcare sector, there is much growth potential following the COVID-19 crisis, analysts said.A senior analyst in the medical industry surnamed Wang who is close to the government told the Global Times that the current registration approval and entry threshold for foreign-funded medical companies in China as well as China's international integration are all conducive for the entry of international innovative products into China, which can allow Chinese people to have direct access to the most advanced international technologies and pharmaceuticals."The huge potential of China's medical market is an indisputable fact," Wang noted. "Foreign investment in China's healthcare sector has been growing quickly since last year," he added.However, it should be recognized that attracting international medical products into China does not mean that it can increase China's medical innovation capabilities, said Wang, suggesting that support for domestic independent innovation and industrial groups should also be enhanced in a bid to narrow the gap between domestic medical giants and their global peers."The overall performance of made-in-China ventilators has been greatly improved in the past five years thanks to the general improvement of personnel capabilities and basic production skills, especially for electronic products," said Liu.Among electronic products, medical equipment has also benefited from the rapid development of technology."The level of our medical device industry is in accordance with the progress of China's overall manufacturing industry," Liu noted.As the COVID-19 pandemic has gathered pace in the West during the past two to three months, Chinese ventilator makers have raced against the clock to guarantee adequate supplies of the life-saving machine.Data from China's General Administration of Customs showed that from March 1 to May 16, China exported a total of 72,700 ventilators to overseas markets.
