You don't emerge the same," he said.But the disputes that have long dominated the world continued to rear their ugly heads.The opening of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound on Sunday was marred by rising Israeli-Palestinian tensions.Israeli soldiers were stationed at the gates of Islam's third holiest site hours after an Israeli police officer shot dead a disabled Palestinian man in nearby annexed east Jerusalem.US President Donald Trump meanwhile faced a backlash after cutting funding to the World Health Organization. It is a major blow for the UN's health agency, as Washington is by far its biggest contributor.The worldwide crisis has further deepened inequality as the costs mount from the global economic shutdown.In Bangkok, motorcycle taxi driver Thanapat Noidee, who shares a tiny hut with his wife and children, said his normal income of $31 a day has been halved."Without food donations, I'll have to fight harder for my family to survive," Thanapat said.AFP
