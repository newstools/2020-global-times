Spring scenery at the campus of Wuhan University in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province. (Xinhua/Cheng Min)After a historically long suspension due to the COVID-19 epidemic, universities in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei Province that harbored more than 80 universities, set in motion to open for graduating students in China's graduation season with strict epidemic-control measures.After a six-month suspension, Wuhan University announced on Wednesday to allow graduating students to return to campus after the results of their COVID-19 nucleic acid and antibody tests show negative, and the cost of the tests will be borne by the university, according to a statement released by the university on Wednesday. Graduating students in China are allowed to voluntarily return to the campus to process their school leaving procedures in two batches as China's graduation season falls in June. The first batch of bachelor and master graduates is scheduled to return from June 8 to 11, and the second batch of students including bachelor, master and doctoral graduates are scheduled from June 14 to 17, reads the statement.These students must return to and leave the campus within the approved time, and those graduating students who choose not return to campus can entrust other students to process their school leaving procedures.Other non-graduating students and those in other countries haven't been approved to return yet.Additionally, students who apply to return to campus should meet other six conditions besides passing the COVID-19 nucleic acid and antibody tests, which include being without flu-like symptom, without contacting confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, having not traveled abroad or contacted people returning from abroad in the past two weeks. Their health QR codes have to be green and they can't have traveled to COVID-19 high-risk regions.Students fulfilled the conditions must have themselves tested in qualified medical institutions and return to the campus within seven days after the tests, and the costs will be reimbursed after they return to campus. Those who returned to the campus ahead of their test results will be quarantined in a designated spot in the university.Students are not allowed to go out of the campus and order food from outside during their stay at the university, and a dormitory room should house no more than 2 persons at the same period of time.Huazhong University of Science and Technology and the Central China Normal University in Wuhan also confirmed to the Global Times on Wednesday that a part of graduating students are allowed to return to campus next week.
