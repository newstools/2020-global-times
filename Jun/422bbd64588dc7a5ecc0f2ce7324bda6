Photo: AFPThe elusive 2001: A Space Odyssey spacesuit believed to have been worn by Dr David Bowman when he "killed" HAL in the groundbreaking 1968 film will go on the auction block in July.The highlight of a Hollywood and space exploration memorabilia show that is set for July 17-18 in Beverly Hills, the spacesuit is conservatively estimated to fetch between $200,000 and 300,000.It is a rare artifact from the classic by filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who is thought to have destroyed most of the props and wardrobe from 2001 - widely regarded as one of the most influential films of all time - to prevent their use in other productions without his authorization.According to Jason DeBord - chief operating officer of Julien's Auctions, which is hosting the event - the only other significant piece from the film to go up at auction was the Aries 1B Trans-Lunar Space Shuttle, which in the movie transported Dr Heywood R. Floyd from the International Space Station to the moon.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences - the organization behind the Oscars - snagged that prop in 2015 for $344,000.The spacesuit is especially sought after because it is believed to have been used in one of the film's most iconic scenes - when Bowman destroys HAL 9000, a sentient computer that is killing the astronauts onboard to uphold its programmed mission.Auctioneers believe this particular costume was used in that scene because its helmet has a base green layer of paint, the color of the helmet worn by Bowman, who was played by Keir Dullea.The film received four Academy Award nominations and won for visual effects, an accolade for its pioneering techniques that included accurately portraying space flight.In 1991, it was added to the US National Film Registry, earmarked for preservation by the Library of Congress.
