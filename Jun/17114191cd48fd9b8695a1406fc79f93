I wanted to speak out," Takei added.Ironically, the cult actor said coming out has increased his job offers, including multiple cameos as himself in sitcoms such as The Big Bang Theory.But issues of racism, police brutality, and a row involving Harry Potter author JK Rowling this week in which she was accused of transphobia, serve as poignant reminders of the progress still needed, said Takei."The root of this kind of bias is all the same, whether it's race, or race combined with war in our case, or by gender identification, it's the same," he said."It's hate - irrational hate."Newspaper headline: Final frontier
