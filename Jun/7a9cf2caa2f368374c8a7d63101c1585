Staff members check the information of passengers entering China at the Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, east China, March 18.Photo:XinhuaAll the passengers landing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport from abroad are required to take a closed-loop 14-day quarantine upon their arrival, including the German business travelers, the airport said on Wednesday. When international flights arrive at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, all of the passengers will accept the closed-loop management in order to prevent imported coronavirus cases from abroad and must take a 14-day quarantine, the airport told the Global Times on Wednesday. Responding to whether the German business personnel on a flight that will be arriving on Thursday will be quarantined for 48 hours through a "fast track" entry system, the airport "has no information."The boundary checkpoint of Shanghai also confirmed to the Global Times that all of the inbound passengers are required to take a 14-day quarantine.A chartered repatriation flight by Lufthansa Airlines carrying some 200 German business travelers from Frankfurt is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Thursday at 11:10am (local time), the second chartered flight taking German managers, workers and family members back to their workplaces in China. However, a passenger on the first chartered flight from Germany to China carrying some 200 German passengers tested positive for coronavirus after arriving in North China's Tianjin although he did not show any symptoms.A person with knowledge of the matter told the Global Times that the forthcoming 200 passengers will take the COVID-19 nucleic acid test once they get off the flight in Shanghai, and will be under closed-loop management.An anonymous source close to the Shanghai health authority told GT that the German businessmen could enjoy flexibility during the quarantine period once their application to go through the "fast track" channel is approved. For example, they are allowed to go to their workplace first, but once the work is finished, they must take the quarantine and all the process in closed-loop management. Jointly arranged by the German Chamber of Commerce in China, German diplomatic missions in China, and Lufthansa airlines, the two flights are the first repatriation flights of foreign nationals from Europe to return to China after the country contained the coronavirus outbreak amid a gradual resumption of economic activities. There are more than 5,000 German companies seeking growth in China and about 60 percent of them are located in Shanghai. Jens Hildebrandt, executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China, told the Global Times previously that there should be a 48-hour quarantine after German passengers' arrival in China.
