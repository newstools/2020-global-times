Panama's Maritime Authority said it will impose sanctions on vessels, including fines of up to $10,000 and withdrawing its flag from the ship, if they deliberately deactivate, tamper with or alter the operation of their tracking transponders.

He said then the advisory would, among other things, warn shippers not to turn off transponders and not to store Iranian oil.Newspaper headline: Panama to fine ships up to $10,000 if they tamper with transponders
