Wuhan, in Central China's Hebei Province, began a three-day inspection of the city's supermarkets, wet markets, and vegetable markets, on Saturday. East China's Zhejiang Province also announced its intentions to thoroughly review the city's food safety standards on Monday.40 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland on Monday, of which 32 were domestically transmitted and eight were imported cases, Chinese health authorities said on Tuesday.
