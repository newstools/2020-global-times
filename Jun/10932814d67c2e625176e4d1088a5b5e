As racial justice protests have swept the US, leading retailers have taken to social media to proclaim their commitment to equality.

Neither company responded to requests for interviews.'A societal issue' Experts who advise retailers say even when there is a will to eliminate bias, doing so is not straightforward.Companies sometimes link security guards' performance evaluations to apprehensions, and some retailers lack robust systems for resolving customers' complaints of profiling.Shaun Gabbidon, a professor at Penn State Harrisburg who recently authored a book on the history of profiling, said retailers have ignored his recommendations to release data on customer apprehensions, which could show if there is racial disparity."The problem is when you have a high-profile incident, no one has enough data to say if this is just a blip," he said.Discussing race can be fraught and should be done in a way that encourages employees to open up and not fear reprisal, experts say."There's no shame in having biases," but it's important to recognize and not act on them, said Anne-Marie Hakstian, a professor at Salem State University. "Of course, it's a societal issue. Racism is all around us."Newspaper headline: Wronged in retail
