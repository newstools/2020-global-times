It is impossible, for example, to leave them parked on Vatican territory.Rome scooter riders face another problem: the city's omnipresent cobblestones, which are difficult to avoid in the streets and alleys of the Eternal City.Still, not all Romans are happy with the flood of electric scooters in the heart of Rome.According to Italian press reports, the development is already arousing protests from taxi associations, who are denouncing the chaos on the streets and "non-compliance with the law," which forces drivers to be extra vigilant because of scooter "mania."Newspaper headline: ‘Small revolution’
