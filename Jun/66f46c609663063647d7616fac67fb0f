Three concurrent crises scarring the US - a deadly health pandemic, economic despair and widespread social unrest - have reframed 2020's presidential contest and prompted national reflection over racial inequality in the country.

"We've never really been free."'Law and order' Trump could have delivered an Oval Office address to the nation this week to smooth tensions. Instead he has exploited discord and launched a "law and order" crusade.Trump has walled off the White House from protesters and launched fiery accusations that do little to calm the storm."The problem," he tweeted Thursday about recent controversial tactics deployed in Washington, "is the arsonists, looters, criminals, and anarchists, wanting to destroy it [and our Country]!"Trump's provocative walk from the White House to a nearby church for a photo opportunity minutes after the area was forcibly cleared of protesters contained clear signals to conservative and evangelical voters in his base: Security and faith remain paramount. While Trump has trafficked in division, his November election rival has blasted him as "dangerously unfit" to lead.Biden, 77, was largely absent for two months, hunkered down in his Delaware home as the pandemic played out and Trump used his bully pulpit to push to reopen the country. But the veteran Democrat is eyeing an opening by embracing a message of conciliation and reform - something that could unite the moderate and liberal factions of the Democratic Party and draw independents appalled by Trump's strongman style."It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people," Biden tweeted on Friday.'Teflon man'Experts say that despite the recent chaos, Trump does have a path to victory. "If the president is able to talk about race in a meaningful way, and if he's able to ride the recovery in health and in the economic crisis, he's going to look like the Teflon man," Gillion said. "Nothing will stick to him."Trump however has seen his poll numbers erode, particularly among two groups vital to his reelection: elderly voters and evangelical Christians. And his failure to tackle the pandemic early and his threat to unleash the military on protesters is repelling female voters.White women "are upset with Trump's handling of the pandemic" and his lack of leadership, said Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African-American studies at Purdue University."Women are also watching the protests and they are having empathy" with demonstrators.The persistent inequalities, snapshots of a shattered economy and how leaders respond "will definitely be on the mind of voters in five months," Brown added. It doesn't mean Biden romps to victory, either. "A cat has nine lives," Brown said, "but Trump has 12."Newspaper headline: Triple challenge
