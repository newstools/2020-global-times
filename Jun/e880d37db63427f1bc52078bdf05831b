This "strategic surrounding" on China is very weak, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Sunday.The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has very high war preparedness in all fronts, but despite tensions, the risk of a large-scale military conflict remains very low thanks to the PLA's strength and strategic deterrence, Wei said.The PLA has demonstrated its capability to maintain high combat readiness in these different regions with intensive, simultaneous military operations, analysts noted.Military exercises will be held in waters off the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea from Wednesday to July 5, according to a notice released by China's Maritime Safety Administration.A PLA Southern Theater Command naval flotilla featuring destroyers and frigates also executed maritime operations in the South China Sea on June 18, China Military Online reported on Friday.In the direction of Taiwan, PLA military aircraft reportedly approached the island at least eight times in June, with many missions speculatively aimed at intercepting US warplanes flying near the island.The PLA 73rd Group Army recently held live-fire amphibious landing exercises featuring heavy weapons and equipment like the ZBD-05 amphibious assault vehicle in East China's Fujian Province, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Friday.All these exercises did not hinder drills near the China-India border region, as a combined brigade attached to the PLA 74th Group Army recently mobilized from thousands of kilometers away to the desert region of Northwest China for daytime and nighttime artillery strike drills, CCTV reported on Saturday.Understanding the PLA's capabilities in the Asia-Pacific, the US is not going to have a hot war with China, so what gave India the courage to think about doing so, Chinese military observers asked.
