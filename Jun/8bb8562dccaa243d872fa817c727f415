Photo: AFPFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Monday launched a furious attack on Turkey's conduct in Libya, accusing the NATO member of playing a "dangerous game" that can no longer be tolerated.In fierce comments likely to rile his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Macron described Turkey's behavior as a telling example of his controversial belief that the military alliance was in the throes of brain death.Ankara supports the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in the conflict against rebel strongman Khalifa Haftar.France is suspected by analysts of backing Haftar alongside Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, but insists it is neutral in the conflict."I believe today that Turkey is playing a dangerous game in Libya and is contravening all the engagements that it made at the Berlin conference" earlier in 2020 on finding peace, Macron said after meeting Tunisian President Kais Saied in Paris.Ankara's role, said Macron, threatened the interests of Libya, its neighbors, the entire region and also Europe.Macron's comments came as a pro-government Turkish newspaper reported Turkey has arrested four of its nationals on suspicion of spying on conservative and religious groups for France.In a sign of convergence between Paris and Cairo on the issue, Macron said he could understand the "legitimate concern" of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has warned advances by Turkey-backed forces could prompt an intervention by Egypt.Libya has been torn by violence, drawing in tribal militias, jihadists and mercenaries since the 2011 toppling and killing of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi in a Western-backed uprising.The oil-rich country is split between rival administrations in the east and west, with the conflict recently attracting increasing foreign involvement. Haftar, a former Kadhafi army commander, has been battling to take the capital Tripoli since 2019.AFP
