More than 8,200 tourist attractions across China will provide pre-registration services online to avoid the spread of the coronavirus, data from Meituan-Dianping showed. It said that tickets for about 87 percent of hot tourist attractions are expected to be sold out three days ahead of time.However, Ji Zhiying, travel industry analyst at Beijing-based consulting and research firm Analysys, told the Global Times that tourists will be wary after Beijing raised its emergency COVID-19 response to level II. Inter-provincial tours are expected to remain suspended.A resident in Shijiazhuang, North China's Hebei Province told the Global Times on Tuesday that she had planned to travel to Beijing for the upcoming holiday but canceled her trip and will instead spend the holiday within his home province.Ji predicted that domestic travel spending during the coming holiday would drop 50 percent year-on-year.According to the China Tourism Academy, Chinese people made more than 95.98 million domestic trips during last year's Dragon Boat Festival and spent 39.3 billion yuan ($5.56 billion)."Prior to the new outbreak in Beijing, we expected that the domestic travel market could see a recovery of 90 percent by the National Day holiday in October. But the market may not totally recover until 2021," Ji said, noting that it would take much longer for the recovery of international travel.Newspaper headline: Dragon Boat travel uptick seen
