In this era of social distancing and depressing news, we could all do with a good hug. Now scientists have analyzed what makes the perfect cuddle - just don't squeeze too tight.Â 

Elementary school students wearing face masks amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus gather for a class in a schoolyard at a reopened school in Tokyo, Japan on Monday, one week after the Japanese government lifted the state of emergency nationwide.

"Therefore, our simple hug experiment might be utilized in the early screening of the autonomic function [that regulates unconscious bodily processes], sensory integration, and development of social recognition in infants with high familial risk for ASD," concluded the scientist.Newspaper headline: Calming effect for infants identified
