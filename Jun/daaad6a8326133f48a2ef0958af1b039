Labor rights are being eroded worldwide as more countries deny workers the ability to strike, unionize and negotiate better terms, a global trade union said on Thursday, warning that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to further setbacks.

"This has got to stop, and be reversed."Activists and academics have warned of a rollback of labor rights in global supply chains, with workers forced to accept worse conditions with fewer jobs available and factory bosses accused of using coronavirus staff culls to fire union members.An increase in the number of countries that deny or constrain freedom of speech shows the fragility of democracies while the number of countries restricting access to justice has remained unacceptably high.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries, including Brazil, India and Mauritius, have amended labor laws in a boost for the private sector at the expense of workers, the ITUC said.Several states in India, for example, are suspending laws on the length of the working day, minimum wage, and worker unions, while Brazil passed measures in March that deny millions of workers the right to collective bargaining."Unscrupulous governments and business are using the pandemic to break workers' organizations, and intimidate their representatives,"Â  Phil Bloomer, head of the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre.The index found at least four in five nations had violated the right to strike and collectively bargain in 2019, while workers had limited or no access to justice in 72 percent of countries. Laborers experienced violence in 51 nations, the ITUC said.About 25 million people are estimated to be victims of forced labor, and companies are facing rising consumer pressure to clean up their supply chains with the issue in the spotlight since the United Nations set a target of ending slavery by 2030.Newspaper headline: Labor facing more setbacks
