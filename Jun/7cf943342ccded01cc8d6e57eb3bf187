Hours after the draft law's details were revealed to the public, the top legislature announced that it will convene for its 20th session from Sunday to next Tuesday in Beijing. Observers said that top lawmakers are expected to vote on the law during the 20th session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
