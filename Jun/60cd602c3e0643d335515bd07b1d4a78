A Russian diplomat sold 10,000 ice creams and candies.Zhou Xuezhi, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that livestreaming can help foreign products open up sales channels in China and trigger a wave of export growth for other countries."For foreign countries, it is difficult to fundamentally boost the economy just by exporting featured products to China, but the economic boost must be positive, especially against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic," Zhou told the Global Times on Wednesday.Tmall is not the first online platform to have diplomats promote their countries' products through livestreaming. In April, Consul General of Argentina in Shanghai Pablo Obregón, staged a live-streaming session on Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo, where he sold Argentine red shrimp to Chinese internet users. According to Pinduoduo, more diplomats will join livestreaming campaigns in the future.
