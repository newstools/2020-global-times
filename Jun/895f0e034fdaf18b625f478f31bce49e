It also drew on medical experts with work experience in epidemic control in Wuhan, especially national experts in epidemiological investigation and environmental elimination, to participate in Beijing's fight against the epidemic.Prevention guidelines require the expansion of sample collection at farmers' markets in Beijing such as Xinfadi, and nucleic acid testing of key areas and populations in Beijing should be expanded and tightened. The guidelines also include the expansion of epidemiological investigations into close contacts and secondary close contacts of confirmed cases, and expanding the scope of quarantine medical observation for relevant personnel.They also call for the strengthening of the management of fever clinics in medical institutions, and improvement regarding reporting and release of epidemic information. A mechanism should be deployed that ensures cases will be reported to higher authorities through an online system within two hours, and laboratory test results to be given within 12 hours, and epidemiological investigations to be completed within 24 hours.Experts are organized to regularly release authoritative information, solving doubts and promoting public awareness education, the working scheme requires.
