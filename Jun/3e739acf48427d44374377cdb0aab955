For example, if there is very serious unrest in Hong Kong and the HKSAR government cannot handle it, the chief executive may ask the national office to deal with it. Also, if the suspect is a very important official, it may not be appropriate for a Hong Kong court to handle the case.In addition, the draft said the chief executive of the HKSAR government shall appoint a number of judges from current or qualified former magistrates, district court judges, judges of the Court of First Instance of the High Court, judges of the Court of Appeal, and judges of the Court of Final Appeal. The judges are responsible for handling crimes that endanger national security.Tong dismissed an accusation by Anita Yip Hau-ki, vice chairman of the Bar Association, who said these appointments would mean "the rule of man." Tong said Yip's claim is "strange," as the Basic Law stipulates that judges in the HKSAR are appointed by the chief executive on the recommendation of an independent commission composed of local judges and eminent persons from the legal profession and other sectors. "Hong Kong's general law and some administrative regulations also allow the chief executive to appoint judges to handle special cases, such as major public investigations," said Tong, noting that "whoever is appointed by the chief executive will hear cases independently, it's not the chief executive hearing the cases, so I don't see anything undermining the independence of the judiciary in Hong Kong.""I don't want to be too critical of them [some people of the association] because I was once the chairman of the association. I just hope professional organizations could speak out from a professional attitude," Tong said.Senior legal figures should understand Hong Kong's legal system, Tong said, while noting that "given they understand, I wonder why they still made such comments. That made me feels very strange."According to Hong Kong media on Sunday, the 20th Session of the 13th NPC Standing Committee will be held from June 28 to 30 in Beijing, and the national security legislation is likely to be enacted before July.Tong said many residents in Hong Kong hope the law can come into effect as soon as possible, and he hopes related authorities can listen to different advice as to how best to make the relevant legislative process. Tong noted the legislation is urgent as Hong Kong now has no law to deal with cases involving national security, which is not good.
