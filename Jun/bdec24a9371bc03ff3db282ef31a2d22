Chinese and Australian national flags are seen at an event in Sydney, Australia. File photo: XinhuaAustralia is waging an intensifying espionage offensive against China - sending agents to China to spy, gather intelligence and recruit assets, instigating defection among Chinese nationals, spying on Chinese students and organizations in Australia, feeding fake news to media to hype up the "China espionage theory" and even in early years attempting to install wiretaps in the Chinese Embassy in Canberra, the Global Times has learned from a source with a Chinese law-enforcement agency. Multiple Australian espionage cases uncovered by Chinese law-enforcement agencies showed that Australia is a veteran in spying against other countries and precisely "the thief who is crying stop the thief" as it steps up infiltration, spying and technological theft operations against China, the source told the Global Times.  In response to Australia's espionage offensive, Chinese counterespionage agencies will take more vigorous countermeasures to crack down on Australian espionage operations to safeguard China's national security and interests, the source said.  Thieves get caught In 2018, a Chinese law-enforcement agency uncovered a spying operation launched by Australia and arrested agents who work for Australian security intelligence agencies, and seized materials, including espionage equipment, US dollars and Chinese yuan used for espionage funds, and the intelligence information they were going to exchange. According to the pictures provided by the source, the Australian spies caught red-handed also had a compass, a USB flash disk, a notebook, a mask, gloves and a map of Shanghai. On the notebook, there was some English handwriting about addresses, which are relevant to their operations.

They tried to escape from China's counterespionage operations by using various sophisticated spying devices, but still, "the approaches that they thought to be reliable and sophisticated also leaked out during China's investigation," the source said.Wiretaps in the embassy  Australian security intelligence agencies have, in recent years, increased espionage activities and surveillance against Chinese institutions and their employees in Australia, including engaging and interrupting local Chinese to force them to spy on local Chinese communities and the Chinese Embassy, and even instigated local Chinese to become their informants to return to China for intelligence gathering or attempted to infiltrate Chinese Embassy and consulates in Australia.  Feng Chongyi, a Chinese Australian "scholar" at the University of Technology Sydney, was an informant to Australian security intelligence agencies, and he provided much information regarding China to Australian security intelligence agencies, and also played the role of a "China studies expert" to stigmatize and smear China on some anti-China foreign media outlets, the source said.Australian security intelligence agencies' espionage activities against China can be traced back to the 1980s-1990s. At that time, Australian security intelligence agencies used the construction of a new Chinese Embassy as a chance to deploy different types of covert listening devices, including seismic wiretaps and high and low frequency electromagnetic induction devices all over the embassy, the source noted. China and Australia established formal diplomatic ties in 1972.After the construction of the building was completed, the relevant Chinese department found covert listening devices inside almost every floor and wall, and even the basement. Given the situation, China had to build a new embassy in Australia. According to the source, Australian intelligence agencies are still conducting espionage against the Chinese Embassy and consulates in the country.

The article says "Pine Gap is fully integrated into the US military's 'kill chain.' It directs drones and missiles onto targets in the Middle East and elsewhere. As a CIA base, it can also eavesdrop on all Australian telephone calls."The source with the Chinese law-enforcement agency noted that "when Australia continually conducts espionage operations against China, it also accuses China of 'espionage.' That's a typical practice of 'a thief crying stop a thief'."

"If Wang defected to Australia as he claimed, he must be in contact with Australian security intelligence agencies and wouldn't be allowed to talk to the media. But how could he get in touch with the media? The only scenario that makes sense is that Australian security intelligence agencies knew he is a swindler but intended to let him talk to the media to spread anti-China or sinophobic sentiment to the public," Chen said."Fake news is not important anymore. As long as Wang could help them create an atmosphere in the country to show that 'Chinese spies are threatening Australia's national security,' the Australian security intelligence agencies will make no comment on the case," Chen noted.Unprecedented hostility The source of the Chinese law-enforcement agency noted that Australia has added more weight to its espionage activities targeting China."Australian security intelligence agencies have increased their budgets and strengthened the construction of espionage intelligence networks against China," the source said. Canberra made such moves because China's rise has put pressure on it, and as a member of the Five Eyes Alliance, Australia feels it has the "responsibility" to collect Chinese intelligence and share it with other "Five Eyes" allies, Chinese analysts said.In fact, Australia is not content with merely being a loyal follower of the US, but wants to make its own decisions, such as announcing a boycott against Chinese 5G telecom giant Huawei, and it even tried to convince other countries to follow, Chen noted.Chen added that on the one hand, Canberra wants to enjoy the benefits brought by the rise of China; on the other, Australia is a typical "Indo-Pacific nation" and wants to use US President Donald Trump and his administration's Indo-Pacific strategy to make itself more important to the US and the West in a competition with China.This is why Australia is nervous, panicking and self-contradicting when dealing with China. In recent years, due to the impact of ideological elements and the worsening of China-US relations, the anti-China conservative forces are becoming increasingly influential in misguiding China-Australia relations, Chinese analysts said.
