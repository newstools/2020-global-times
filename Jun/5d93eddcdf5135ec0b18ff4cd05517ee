It is an indispensable institution in the fight against impunity for international crimes, and it is needed today more than it has ever been.""We reject any attempts to put pressure on the independent court, its staff, and those who work with it," the ministry stressed.The French Foreign Ministry on Friday urged the United States to refrain from implementing measures targeting ICC officials.The US decision "represents a serious attack on the Court and the States Parties to the Rome Statute, and beyond that, a challenge to multilateralism and judicial independence," French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement published on the ministry's website.France reiterated its full support for the court, which bashed the US sanctions later on Thursday. "The Court is the only permanent international criminal court with a universal vocation," Le Drian said.Noting the court plays a vital role in the fight against impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes, Le Drian said "France will strive to ensure that the Court is able to fulfill its mission in an independent and impartial manner."The ICC in March authorized an investigation into possible war crimes in Afghanistan, including those that may have been committed by the US military and the Central Intelligence Agency, which could lead to the indictment of US military and intelligence personnel.
