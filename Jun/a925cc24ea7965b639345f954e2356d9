"Ten, nine, eight…three, two, one. Launch," the calm voice of 01 Commander Yin Xiangyuan in the valley of Liangshan mountain in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, was soon overwhelmed by the thunderous boom of the rocket taking off on Tuesday. Carrying the last satellite of China's domestically developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, or BDS, the Long March-3B launch vehicle blasted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center on Tuesday morning. And after a flight of around 30 minutes, the spacecraft, the third geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite and 30th of the third-generation series of the BeiDou system, or BDS-3, successfully entered its planned orbit, marking the completion of the global geolocation network, which is also China's largest space-based system and one of the four global navigation networks, along with the US' GPS, Russia's GLONASS and the European Galileo. The launch of the final satellite of China's indigenous BeiDou system had been previously scheduled on June 16, but was delayed after technical problems were found with the Long March-3B rocket in pre-launch tests.Space launches have always been full of challenges and sometimes faced with high risks of failure. The postponement of the final BeiDou launch and resumption after resolving the problems once again demonstrated that Chinese space scientists uphold the scientific spirit, allowing zero errors at any stage of the mission, insiders said.

BDS has played an important role in ensuring security at major events, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Meeting and the G20 Summit. In the field of smart phones, mainstream chip manufacturers both at home and abroad have introduced integrated chips that are compatible with BDS. By the third quarter of 2019, more than 400 smartphone models sold in China supported positioning functions, of which about 300 models supported BDS.The scale of navigation satellite positioning and navigation industry in China has reached 345 billion yuan ($48.6 billion) by 2019, up 14.4 percent from the previous year, according to an annual industry report. Cao Chong, a Beijing-based senior expert on satellite navigation industry, told the Global Times the industry scale is expected to exceed 400 billion by the end of 2020. Cao said the next step to further promote the BDS system in market both at home and abroad lies in the research and development of terminal capabilities, which should keep up with the enhanced power of BDS-3. "There are huge market potentials to be released."The Tuesday mission marked the 44th BeiDou satellite-launching flight for the Long March-3A rocket series since October 31, 2000, which the Long March-3B rocket belongs to. The rockets have sent 59 BeiDou satellites, including four experimental ones, into orbit, with a 100 percent success rate. As the BDS system continues to develop, the Long March-3A rocket series have also started to use three-mode receptors which are compatible with the BDS, GPS and GLONASS networks, Jiang Jie, chief engineer of the rocket series, with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle, also under the CASC, told the Global Times. As the three modes all complement each other, they work together to improve the orbiting accuracy of rockets and reduce consumption of propellants, Jiang noted.
