With the Chinese government taking the lead, the Chinese military, businesses and individuals are all stepping up, reaching out a helping hand to local governments, hospitals, schools and the homeless," the ambassador said.He said according to preliminary figures, China has now donated to Zimbabwe over 719,000 face masks, more than 21,000 testing kits and more than 100,000 pieces of protective gear to help the nation combat the pandemic.Last month, China sent a 12-member team of medical experts to Zimbabwe on a two-week exchange program during which they shared their experience on tackling COVID-19 with local medical staff.At the end of the mission, the team made several recommendations on tackling the pandemic to the Zimbabwe government.Guo once again reiterated China's call for the immediate lifting of Western sanctions on Zimbabwe, saying the restrictive measures were further hurting the country's efforts to combat the deadly virus.The sanctions were also hindering humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe, currently facing a deteriorating economic situation marked by hyperinflation and shortage of essentials such as fuel and foreign currency, the ambassador said."We call for certain country to respect the legitimate rights, interests and life of the affected people and immediately lift all unilateral sanctions," Guo said.Zimbabwe's COVID-19 cases have surged in recent weeks from 149 at the end of May to 320 as of June 11, spurred by citizens who are returning from neighboring countries.
