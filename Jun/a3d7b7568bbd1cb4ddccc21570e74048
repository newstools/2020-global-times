Photo: AFPThe coronavirus pandemic is "not even close to being over," the World Health Organization (WHO) warned Monday, as the global death toll passed half a million and cases surged in Latin America and the US. In another grim milestone, the number of infections recorded worldwide topped 10 million, while some authorities reimposed lockdown measures that have crippled economies worldwide."We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. "But the hard reality is this is not even close to being over," he said, adding that "although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up."COVID-19 is still rampaging across the US, which has recorded more than 125,000 deaths and 2.5 million cases - both around a quarter of the global totals.US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the April-June quarter was expected to see the largest decline in GDP on record, adding that recovery would depend on government efforts to contain the outbreak.Many of the south and west US states where the novel coronavirus is most rampant are where state leaders pushed for early reopenings.But even in New York, deemed to be in good health comparatively, the iconic Broadway theatre district announced it would remain closed through the end of 2020.And with numerous US states forced to reimpose restrictions on restaurants, bars and beaches, US President Donald Trump has come under growing pressure to set an example by wearing a mask.Trump's health secretary has warned the "window is closing" for the US to regain control, but the president has largely turned away from the crisis, holding indoor rallies with big, largely maskless crowds against the advice of his experts and refusing to cover his own face in public.The second hardest-hit country Brazil registered 259,105 infections in the seven days through Sunday - the country's highest of any week during the pandemic.Ireland's pubs began pouring pints for the first time in 15 weeks, as Europe - still the hardest-hit continent - continues to open up after seeing numbers of new cases fall."Guinness is good for you," quipped Mark O'Mahony - the first to order a pint with his breakfast at a Dublin pub. "Without it, it hasn't been much good really for 15 weeks."In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country had gone through a "profound shock" as he prepared to unveil a large stimulus program.His government plans to reopen pubs, restaurants and hairdressers across England on Saturday.AFP
