They've always been this way."During social unrest in Hong Kong last summer, Twitter suspended 936 accounts, claiming they "undermine the legitimacy and political positions" of the protests in the city, while Facebook suspended the Hong Kong police force's 10 anti-violence WhatsApp hotlines - only three days after the service's launch.Anti-violence citizens protested against Facebook in front of its office in Hong Kong in August saying the platform acts against fair and equity principle by unreasonably cracking down on anti-violence net users and whitewashing the unrest in Hong Kong, calling for drop of double standards on violent protests.However, large American companies operating in Hong Kong at the time did not pressure Facebook to build a welcoming and inclusive internet environment.As some politicians of the "deep state" in the US advocate and encourage violent protests in Hong Kong out of their animosity toward China, it's possible that Facebook and Twitter might be forced to remove accounts that speak against violence and support the Hong Kong police, Cao Heping, a professor of economics at Peking University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday."But what's a pity is that such moves will only lead Facebook and Twitter to become political tools, or hostages to Western politics, rather than responsible public platforms," Cao said.Newspaper headline: Social media become ‘tools’
