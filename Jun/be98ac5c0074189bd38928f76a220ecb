Chinese law retains the death penalty while strictly controlling its application," Zhao said.Chinese judicial organs deal with criminals of different nationalities in accordance with the law. The relevant court in China made the judgment on the basis of ascertaining the facts of the crime in an open trial. China will continue to protect the legal rights of those involved in the case in accordance with the law and will allow for consular visits by the Australian side in accordance with relevant international conventions and the China-Australia Consular Agreement.
