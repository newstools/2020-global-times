Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam speaks at a press conference in Hong Kong, south China, May 15, 2020. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)Some countries' high-profile criticism of the national security law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shows "double standards," as they pay attention to their own national security but are biased against HKSAR, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said at a press conference on Tuesday, the US' recent dealing with its domestic riots has been tough.Safeguarding national security is the basis of every country's sovereignty. Hong Kong has laws to stem infringement of national security, but these are insufficient. The risk of violating national security in Hong Kong is increasing and "we all know what happened last year," Lam said. Activities seeking secession, foreign interference, and activities that aim at overthrowing the local government cause residents to live in fear, which means there is no more rule of law but only rule of fear. The central government cares about Hong Kong people and will not do nothing, she said. Carrie Lam said that some countries' sanctions against Hong Kong over the national security law are "hurting others without bringing any good to themselves." Hong Kong has been the economic entity that the US has had the largest trade surplus with for more than a decade. It offers favorable policies for more than 1,300 US companies based in Hong Kong to do business in the Chinese mainland. Imposing sanctions on Hong Kong amid a slump in the global economy would worsen the economic situation and people's livelihood in many places, she said.Global Times
