More than 6,000 kilograms of bamboo rats, snakes and porcupines were buried in a landfill in Xianning, Central China's Hubei Province, after China banned the farming of some wild animals and called for them to be disposed of without affecting the environment.
Seven porcupines, 900 bamboo rats and 4,000 kilograms of snakes were put in large pits, covered with lime, and buried, according to a video posted by Qingjiao Video on Monday.
An official from the forestry bureau at the landfill site said in the video that it will help minimize the impact on the environment.
China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs released a national catalogue of livestock and poultry on May 29. A number of wild animals that have long been farmed in China, such as civet cats, bamboo rats, snakes, porcupines and swamp rats, were excluded from the list. 
Hubei and some other provinces later issued guidelines, specifying that the animals confiscated from farmers may be released into the wild, used for research and medical purposes or disposed of without affecting the environment, while those who raised them will also receive compensation from the government.
