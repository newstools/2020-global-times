He also wants to launch a competition to give free access to satellites and launchers to startups, to spur innovation.For the Galileo satnav system, Breton said he would bring forward to the end of 2024 instead of 2027 the rollout of a new generation of satellites, "the most modern in the world," that can interact with each other and provide a more precise signal.AFP
