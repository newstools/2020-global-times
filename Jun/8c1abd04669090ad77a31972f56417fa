Located in Jiangkou township of southwest China's Sichuan province, the 17.4-meter-long stone dragon dates back to Song Dynasty (960-1279). As the stone carving had been exposed to the elements, it was covered with mud and weeds. The local government started a renovation project on the stone dragon in March, and the work has completed in May.

According to historic records, a businessman surnamed Wang in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province invented the novel means of exchange, according to a report from Sina News.Wang convened a meeting with  16 other merchants, who agreed to use paper printed with the same patterns and various numbers as a currency during exchanges. The ease at which this paper currency could be carried made it an immediate hit among merchants, who often needed to travel extensively.Its popularity among the general populace made the government at the time take notice, which helped ease its management. Therefore, the government of Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) released the first official jiaozi in 1024 and established an agency to regulate the issuance of paper currency.
