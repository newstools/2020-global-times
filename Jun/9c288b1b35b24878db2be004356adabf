Nevertheless, we all know that this global challenge can only be conquered through cooperation," Raffarin said."Culture plays a vital role in the promotion of the cooperative spirit in global development," he added. "Music is a celebration, and culture is friendship."During the concert, many revered folk songs of China were performed, as well as a folk rendition of classic French songs "La Vie en Rose" and "Les Champs-Elysees."The event was co-hosted by the China Cultural Center in Paris and China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater, along with Chinese artists in France and students at the center.When Central China's city of Wuhan reported the COVID-19 cases, many renowned cultural figures in France showed their support to China's fight against the epidemic, the Chinese embassy in France said in a statement.More than 300 French artists and cultural workers had jointly issued a public letter, 40 theater performing artists lent their voice to the collaborative song "Together," and players of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club wore jerseys with "Be Strong, China" printed on them.When France reported rising cases of COVID-19, the Chinese side also provided assistance in delivering medical supplies to France, the embassy statement said.  Newspaper headline: A return to normality
