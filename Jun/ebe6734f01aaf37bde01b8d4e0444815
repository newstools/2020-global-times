Efforts to halt its spread by imposing restrictions on everyday life have plunged economies into recession.However in Europe, schools, pools, pubs and tourist sites have begun to open, defying warnings that this could trigger a second wave of infections.The US - where the pandemic has been overshadowed by unrest following the death of a black man at the hands of a white police officer - remains by far the worst-affected country.But novel coronavirus cases are spreading quickly in Latin America. Brazil, Peru, Chile and Mexico are experiencing the largest daily increases, while the numbers are on the rise in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Haiti."Countries are having to work very, very hard to both understand the scale of infection but also health systems are beginning to come under pressure across the region," said Ryan, speaking at a virtual press conference from Geneva. He expressed particular concern for Haiti.Latin America has passed one million cases and recorded more than 50,000 deaths. Brazil has reported more than half of those cases and close to 60 percent of the fatalities.Mexico also began reopening on Monday, reactivating the automotive industry, mining and construction even though the country has recorded more than virus 10,000 deaths - second only to Brazil in Latin America.In Europe, from Russia to France, Italy and Britain, countries have started to emerge from months-long lockdowns, cautiously adopting a post-pandemic version of normal.Â Bars began to serve again in Finland and Norway, while some schools in Britain and Greece opened their doors again.AFP
