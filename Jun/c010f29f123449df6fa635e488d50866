But Jace Tyrrell, CEO of New West End Company, a partnership of 600 British and international operators in the area, predicted it will be "quite some time until we get back to normal.""Retailers are going to have to adapt," she told AFP. Britain has been among the worst-hit countries by the pandemic, with the number of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 deaths passing 50,000 last week, according to official statistics.The government's less comprehensive rolling daily death count of those who have tested positive for the virus stands at nearly 42,000.Despite the grim tolls, the transmission rate has dropped dramatically since the pandemic's peak in Britain in early April.
