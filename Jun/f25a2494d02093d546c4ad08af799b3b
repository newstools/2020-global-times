Microsoft China is wholly owned by Microsoft, according to Tianyancha."Being included as 'the person subject to enforcement' is not a punishment. The name refers to the party to be dealt with in a case," a certified lawyer said on his personal Sina Weibo account."The information only shows that Microsoft China lost a civil lawsuit, and it did not pay when the time stipulated in the judgment was up. The winning party applied for enforcement to the court, which was accepted, that's all. It is not clarified with whom and in what case Microsoft China had the lawsuit. Whether Microsoft has defaulted on its debts, whether it will be able to pay back the money, whether it will be blacklisted, these questions remain unknown," explained the lawyer.According to Tianyancha, Microsoft China has faced multiple lawsuits. It has been sued 11 times for disputes over sales contracts and seven times for patent infringement.Newspaper headline: Microsoft China listed as 'person subject to enforcement', liable for payment of 1m yuan
