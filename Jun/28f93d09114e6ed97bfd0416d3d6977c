But now, he prefers to go to the Karakoy port for fishing as it is calmer and safer."The bridge is the most crowded fishing location in the entire city," he told Xinhua.In Demir's view, most of the regulars of the bridge are economically deprived people and their sole concern is to make a living out of some fish they can get each day.With 900 to 1,000 new cases are recorded each day, the coronavirus still poses a significant threat to the Turkish society, said health officials.On Monday, Turkey confirmed 989 new COVID-19 cases and 19 more deaths in the past 24 hours, raising the total number of cases in the country to 171,121 and the death toll to 4,711, according to the latest official data.
