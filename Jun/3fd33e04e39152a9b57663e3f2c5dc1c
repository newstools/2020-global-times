Newspapers and magazines will no longer be allowed on board, and duty-free sales will be limited.The wearing of a mask or face covering should be obligatory inside aircraft and terminals, where physical distancing of at least three feet (one meter) should be respected.Terminal access will be limited to passengers and their companions, such as those accompanying disabled travelers, and airport personnel.Aboard planes, passengers should wear masks, move as little as possible within the cabin, and not line up outside toilets to lessen the risk of infecting other passengers. People will be assigned specific toilet stalls on the plane in relation to where they are seated.Flight attendants will be provided with personal protective equipment that could include visors and medical masks.But the ICAO does not advocate leaving every other seat open to assure physical distancing, a restriction that the airline industry sees as a threat to its profitability.The organization, nevertheless, asks passengers to remain as far from one another as possible.AFP
