Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks at a press conference in Tehran, Iran, on Oct. 14, 2019. (Xinhua/Ahmad Halabisaz)Iran said Monday it has called for Interpol to help arrest US President Donald Trump and 35 other US officials for January's killing of its top general in an American drone strike.Tehran prosecutor Ali Qasi Mehr, quoted by state news agency IRNA, said 36 US political and military officials "involved in the assassination" of General Qasem Soleimani "have been investigated and were ordered to be arrested through Interpol.""These people have been charged with murder and terrorist acts," he said."At the top of the list is US President Donald Trump, and his prosecution will continue even after the end of his term," said the prosecutor, referring to his bid for re-election in November.Qasi Mehr, quoted on the judiciary's Mizan Online official website, said "the Iranian judiciary has issued arrest warrants against the 36."He called for the international police agency Interpol to issue red notices, which are not arrest warrants but issued for those wanted for prosecution or sentencing.Interpol, however, told AFP that any such intervention would be contrary to its constitution, without directly confirming it had been contacted by Iran.Under Article 3 of the constitution, "it is strictly forbidden for the Organization to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character," said the agency based in the French city of Lyon."Interpol would not consider requests of this nature."Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani in a January 3 drone strike near Baghdad international airport.Soleimani, a national hero at home, was "the world's top terrorist" and "should have been terminated long ago," Trump said at the time.Iran retaliated by firing a volley of ballistic missiles at US troops stationed in Iraq, but Trump opted against responding militarily.AFP
