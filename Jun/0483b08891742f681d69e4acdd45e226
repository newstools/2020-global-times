Memet Abdula was suspected of crimes involving bribery and abuse of power to seek profits from others. His case was then transferred to the judicial authorities for further investigation. After two trials, Memet Abudla was sentenced for the crime of bribery. His criminal sentence was based on clear facts and solid evidence in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations, according to the spokesperson.His daughter's allegation that he was framed was just an attempt to confuse truth and falsehood. Corruption is a tumor to social development and is detested by people. Anyone who violates the rules, regardless of his or her ethnicity, will surely be brought to justice, the spokesperson said.
