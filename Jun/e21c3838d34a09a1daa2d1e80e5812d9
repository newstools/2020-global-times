Tropical rainforests disappeared at a rate of one soccer field every six seconds in 2019, researchers said on Tuesday, urging countries to include forest protection in post-pandemic plans.

Brazil will accept foreign aid to help fight fires in the Amazon rainforest on the condition the Latin American country controls the money, the president's spokesman said Tuesday.

"The situation has changed," Weisse said of the COVID-19 pandemic. "What we need to do has also changed."The top three countries for primary forest loss in 2019 - Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Indonesia - have remained largely the same this century, GFW researchers said.Brazil accounted for more than a third of all primary forest loss in 2019 at 1.36 million hectares. Neighboring Bolivia experienced record-breaking primary forest loss.Newspaper headline: 2019 witnesses 3.8 million hectares of deforestation
