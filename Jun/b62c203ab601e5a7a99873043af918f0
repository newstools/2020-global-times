Fei Yu-ching, the singer-songwriter from the island of Taiwan who first sang the classic Chinese song Yi Jian Mei in 1983 Photo: VCGChinese netizens have expressed surprise that the classic Chinese song "Yi Jian Mei" (original name of "Xue Hua Piao Piao") has become the first Chinese song to go viral in the US and other Western countries and become an international meme on social media platforms such as Tik Tok and Twitter, with many of them saying that the internet sometimes helps promote cultural exchange in unexpected ways.Recently, a video known as " Asian Man Singing in the Snow " or "Xue Hua Piao Piao" (the lyrics of the song performed in the video), depicting an Asian man with an egg-shaped head performing Yi Jian Mei - which means plum blossom branch - while twirling in the snow and filming himself has gained mainstream popularity, according to a report by internet memes research website Know Your Meme.Yi Jian Mei was first sung by the singer-songwriter Fei Yu-ching from the island of Taiwan in 1983 and has been extremely popular for decades in Chinese culture. The video of the song on YouTube had been viewed over 16 million times as of Monday, after it became popular in the English-speaking world. It was also trending in many countries' music lists, including those in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and New Zealand.The original video was first posted by user zaq13520000789 on Kuaishou, a short video platform, as early as January 20, and gained almost 3 million views and more than 8,600 comments as of Monday after YouTube user Goated Beats uploaded the clip four weeks ago.After the video went viral, many TikTokers remixed the song and created a deep-fried meme trend to pair it with Tik Tok, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. Some internet users even made rap videos mixed with Yi Jian Mei and Wild for the Night performed by Skrillex or a clip from the Regular Show.   The news attracted the attention of many Chinese internet users, even though many of them felt confused over the song's sudden popularity."Why has a long-time Chinese song that didn't reach the mainstream in the US become well-known at this time?" one netizen asked, adding that "I still don't get it after seeing the video of the egg-like man in the snow.""It is because of the egg-like man's hilarious physical deformity. People in the West may find it hilarious and like repeating it, as it's mysterious and exotic," another replied. "It is just for fun."Although many netizens said they would never have thought that this quintessentially Chinese song could catch the attention of many people from the West, they admitted that its remixed raps sound good."Social media does help foster cultural exchanges between countries with totally different backgrounds, though in unexpected ways sometimes. You never know when and how a certain song suddenly becomes popular," one commented.
