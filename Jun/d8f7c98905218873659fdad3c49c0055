The US' one is so rude and arrogant compared to our Hong Kong officers," said one netizen."The US kept using the name of freedom and saying that police used excessive forces in Hong Kong, but look what the American police do? Do they ever feel shameful?" asked another, adding that "the US government is so double-standard and only wants to cause trouble in other countries to maintain its supremacy."Global Times
