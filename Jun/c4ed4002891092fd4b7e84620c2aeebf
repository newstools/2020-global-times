It was due to have ended on Monday. Greece was quick to introduce strict confinement measures on the teaming migrant camps on March 21 and imposed a more general lockdown on March 23.While no known coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the camps so far and only a few dozen infections have surfaced, the measures have since been extended a number of times.Rights groups have expressed concern that migrants' rights have been eroded by the restrictions.Earlier on Saturday, members of anti-racist groups, joined by refugees from migrant camps, marched in central Athens, holding banners proclaiming "No refugee homeless, persecuted, jailed" and chanting slogans against evictions of refugees from temporary accommodation in apartments.Thousands face homelessness as Greek authorities plan to move more than 11,000 people to make room for other asylum seekers currently living in dismal island camps.Refugees used to be able to keep their accommodation for up to six months after receiving protected status. The new government has reduced this to just a month.The government insists that it is doing everything necessary "to assure a smooth transition for those who leave their lodgings."AFP
