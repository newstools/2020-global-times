DNA research on the Dead Sea Scrolls has revealed that not all of the ancient manuscripts came from the desert landscape where they were discovered, according to a study published on Tuesday.

Others argue that some of the texts were hidden by Jews fleeing the advance of the Romans.  "These initial results will have repercussions on the study of the life of Jews during the period of the Second Temple" in Jerusalem that was destroyed by the Romans in AD70, said Shor.Such archaeological research remains a sensitive subject in Israel and the Palestinian territories, as findings are sometimes used by organizations or political parties to justify their claims to contested land.Beatriz Riestra, a researcher who took part in the study, pointed to "differences at the same time in the content and the style of calligraphy, but also in the animal skin used for the parchment, proving they are of different origin."In total, some 25,000 parchment fragments have been discovered and the texts have been continuously studied for more than 60 years."It's like piecing together parts of a puzzle," said Oded Rechavi, a professor who led the Tel Aviv University team."There are many scrolls fragments that we don't know how to connect, and if we connect wrong pieces together it can change dramatically the interpretation of any scroll," he said.
