Many netizens have complained there are too many high ranking topics exclusively on entertainment celebrities. The punishment decision was made public on the cyberspace administration's official site, but the details of the incident were not fully disclosed in the notice. Many believe it refers to the public opinion event which led to the fall of Jiang Fan, who was the president of Alibaba's e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, and was removed from its company partnership, after an internal investigation into allegations of improper behavior.Jiang was also stripped of a partnership in Alibaba Group in April, after his wife surnamed Dong accused him of engaging in an extramarital affair, which stirred up a public relations storm on Weibo. Alibaba later said Jiang had negatively impacted the company's image.The personnel involved will be also punished and the regulator has also fined Weibo an undisclosed sum.Officials with the cyberspace administration stressed the responsibilities of online platforms and emphasized the internal review process, which should not allow the spread of illegal information or the interference of normal presentation and communication online.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
