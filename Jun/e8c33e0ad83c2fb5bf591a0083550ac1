The head of the US agency that warns of dangerous weather violated its policy on scientific integrity with a statement in 2019 backing a tweeted forecast by US President Donald Trump about the path of a hurricane, according to a report released on Monday.

Volz said in his memo that Jacobs and Roberts did not believe it was a good idea to release a statement, but "felt significant external pressure to do so."The controversy became known as "Sharpiegate," after Trump displayed a modified NOAA map to depict the storm threatening Alabama.The New York Times reported in 2019 that Ross threatened to fire top employees after the Birmingham office contradicted Trump and that then acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had directed Ross to order the NOAA to disavow the NWS tweet.In a statement on the NOAA website responding to the NAPA report, Jacobs said its analysis was based on the premise that either Trump's tweet, or that from the Birmingham office was right, and the NOAA was choosing between the two, which was not the case. "NAPA never questions or refutes the scientific veracity of the actual statement," he said.Newspaper headline: US agency breached science policy: report
