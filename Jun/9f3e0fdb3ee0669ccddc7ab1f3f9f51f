Restoration work on the Notre Dame Cathedral is at a standstill during the containment period caused by COVID-19 outbreak, in Paris, France, April 15, 2020. (Photo by Aurelien Morissard/Xinhua)Paris officials on Sunday removed the tall metal barriers surrounding the square in front of Notre-Dame cathedral, offering visitors a close-up look at the Gothic monument for the first time since the devastating fire that struck in 2019."It's almost a form of rebirth today," Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, wearing a face mask, said in a short address to journalists while visiting the site with the cathedral's rector Patrick Chauvet.The square began to fill up under sunny afternoon skies as word of the unexpected reopening spread.The monumental facade and arched entrances remain blocked, however, behind beige security barriers as workers prepare to resume restoration work as France's coronavirus lockdown is lifted.The plaza was closed off shortly after the blaze on April 15, 2019, that nearly destroyed the 13th-century church, which millions of people watched on live TV worldwide.The fire completely consumed the oak beams and more than 300 tons of lead paneling in the roof.Heavy concentrations of the metal settled on the square and nearby streets that proved particularly difficult to remove, sparking fears that residents could be exposed to poisoning.Several schools were closed for weeks as workers decontaminated classrooms and playgrounds, and restoration work was halted after authorities demanded face masks and other protective gear for workers.But the regional health authority gave its approval Friday for reopening the site, which will be cleaned regularly as the renovation slowly resumes.AFP
