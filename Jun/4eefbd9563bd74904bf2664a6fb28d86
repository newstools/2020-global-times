People send flowers outside the church where George Floyd's funeral is held in Houston, Texas, the United States, on June 9, 2020. The funeral of African American George Floyd was held Tuesday in the southern U.S. city of Houston, where he was brought up and spent most of his life, two weeks after his tragic death in police custody in Minneapolis.

Lee, the general who led the southern Confederate forces in the 1861-65 Civil War. That statue and others like it remain in place amid strident resistance from those who reject the view that Lee represents racism and that slavery was the core issue behind the war.Suggesting that the tide could be turning, on June 4 Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced that a statue of Lee in Richmond, capital of the Confederacy, would be taken down.But a local judge Monday temporarily blocked the removal of the statue after a Virginia resident sued to keep it in place. In other areas in the South, communities have pulled down some of the old monuments to the Confederacy as symbols of oppression and slavery. On Tuesday, Houston said farewell to Floyd in a rousing hometown funeral, with poignant tributes and calls for justice for the 46-year-old African-American whose death "touched the world" and ignited global protests against police brutality and racism.AFP
