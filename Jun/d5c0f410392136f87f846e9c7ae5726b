"I think the mainland stock exchanges want to make sure that the connection between secondary listings and mainland markets can be smooth and don't trigger too much volatility," he told the Global Times. He also said that there might be some technical issues that involve secondary listings to be included in the stock link programs, but they will only be a temporary hindrance to the inclusion of companies like Alibaba. Xi Junyang, a professor at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, said that the chances are great for such inclusion amid a trend for US-listed Chinese companies to shift their listings and when the mainland is pushing for financial opening-up.He predicted that the mainland will further broaden its links with the Hong Kong stock market by incorporating more companies into the stock link programs and further lifting the trading quota.But as the mainland already has reforms to implement, such as expanding experiments of the registration-based IPO system, so reforms of the stock link programs will likely be carried out in 2021 instead of this year, Xi said. Charles Li Xiaojia also said that Hong Kong welcomes qualified companies listed overseas to list on the Hong Kong bourse, whether they are primary or secondary listings."We believe they chose to return because the US market environment can't bring enough confidence," he said, but added that Hong Kong does not welcome companies that were forced to delist from the US because of their own flaws. The Hong Kong bourse ranked first globally in terms of IPO proceeds in 2019, completing 169 IPOs and raising funds of HK$314.5 billion ($40.6 billion), cementing its position as the world's leading IPO hub. Newspaper headline: Alibaba, JD.com likely to be included in stock links
