"The docking of the Crew Dragon happened to have a good sunshine condition up there."Some also floated the idea that docking above China was a friendly sign, or an invitation to China's space agency or private companies for further cooperation in the space sector. "That is very unlikely," said Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator.Song told the Global Times on Tuesday that "space cooperation between China and the US is strictly limited by various US laws."Even the SpaceX mission was contracted by the NASA, so there is little possibility of space cooperation in the near future between China and the US, and not even between Chinese private firms and SpaceX, according to the experts.Since the launch of the SpaceX mission, China has also completed successful launches at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province and at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, sending four satellites into their planned orbit.
