The WHO announced on Wednesday the resumption of its hydroxychloroquine trials after The Lancet cast doubt over a large-scale study it published in May that led to temporary suspension of testing of the drug.

However, in an open letter on May 29, a group of scientists raised "both methodological and data integrity concerns" about it. These included a lack of information about the countries and hospitals.Newspaper headline: WHO resumes drug trials
