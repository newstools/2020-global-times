We believe that the MSC system will be delivered on schedule and it will provide our customers in both countries with a fast and reliable international connectivity experience," said M.S. Tanwar, chief technology and information officer of Ooredoo Maldives PLC.Huawei Marine was established in 2008 as a joint venture with Britain's Global Marine.

In 2019, it secured over 10 contracts, the firm said on its official website, noting that the projects are pioneering applications for the latest technologies, like 16 fiber-pair SDM repeaters.Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
