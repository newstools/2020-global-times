They dug up information from social media and that way built an ideological and political profile," said the source.The complaint was lodged by Cristina Caamano, who has been tasked by center-left President Alberto Fernandez to carry out an audit of AFI as part of a reorganization process.According to the complaint, the profile information included "political preferences, social media posts, sympathy for feminist groups, or political and/or cultural content among others."The comments included whether or not "they were critical of the current government" of Macri, who held office from 2015-19. Other comments referred to "showing affinity for Peronism," Fernandez's political movement that was in opposition at the time, "supporting the government," and "asking on Facebook for the liberation of Lula," the jailed leftist former Brazilian president who has since been released. Each profile was marked.
