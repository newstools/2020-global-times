The opening price was 1,000 yuan.   When Buffet held his luncheon auction in China, people were envious of those who attended. Chinese netizens, however, are mocking Li's auction, and recalling his previous controversies, including smashing a cup in anger during a media interview and the time he stormed into Dangdang's office in Beijing and took the company's seals, which are used to verify company documents. "What do those biding for lunch with Li Guoqing expect to learn? How to steal seals?" a Weibo user commented. "Try not to smash any cups during the lunch," wrote another. Li and Yu were together ranked 573rd on the Hurun Rich List 2019 with a fortune of 7 billion yuan ($991 million), according to media reports.
