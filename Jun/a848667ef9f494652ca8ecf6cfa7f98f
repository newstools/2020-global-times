(Xinhua/Wang Ying) Chinese scientists predicted that 20-30 percent of the US population may potentially be infected in one year as the US recorded the highest single day spike in COVID-19 infections on Thursday and its CDC chief said coronavirus cases may be 10 times higher than reported.Chinese experts believe that the continuing large-scale domestic protests, premature reopening and the presidential campaigns escalated the severity of the outbreak.CDC Director Robert Redfield indicated Thursday that at least 24 million Americans, 10 times as high as the 2.4 million confirmed cases, may have been infected so far, the Washington Post reported.The US reported over 40,000 new cases on Thursday, a record single day increase.Liang Manchun, an associate research fellow at the Institute for Public Safety Research of Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Friday that the infection data reflected a new peak of the outbreak emerging in the country and the startling increase of coronavirus cases has reversed the previous downward trend. "Some states in the country have for now made good progress on flattening the curve of infection, others have seen cases surge again which has caused the new peak," Liang noted.Any one of the US states, which could prevent and control the pandemic seriously, could flatten the curve of infection within three to four months, Liang said.Liang noted the development of the US' epidemic is currently different from their predictions.About one month ago, they predicted the epidemic development in the US could be similar to that of some European countries such as Italy.
