Chile has now registered more than 113,000 infections and 1,275 deaths.Â But outside of Latin America nations are cautiously reopening schools, beaches and businesses after months of quarantine, even as some still face rising numbers of cases.European nations among the hardest hit by the outbreak have mostly flattened out infection curves. They have turned to the tricky task of balancing economic recovery against the risk of a second wave of cases.Germany will plow 130 billion euros ($146 billion) into a stimulus package to kick-start an economy severely hit by the pandemic, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced.Italy - the first country badly hit in Europe - opened its borders to European travelers Wednesday, hoping tourism will revive its recession-hit economy three months after its shutdown.AFP
