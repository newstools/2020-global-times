The only bright spark is the Major Purchase Index with a six-point fillip, the survey said."As the lockdown eases, it will be interesting to see just how the consumer appetite for spending returns in a world of socially-distanced shopping and the seismic shift to online retailing -- alongside worries of a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases as relaxations increase," Staton said.According to the government's three-step plan to lift lockdown, from May 13, workers who are unable to work from home can travel to work if their workplace is open. Outdoor markets and car showrooms are allowed to reopen from June 1 in England and all non-essential retailers will be able to reopen in England from June 15.The government has published new guidance for the retail sector to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards.
