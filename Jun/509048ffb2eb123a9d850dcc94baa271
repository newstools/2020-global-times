(Xinhua/Martin Zabala)A public hospital in the Argentine town of Ezeiza, located in southern Greater Buenos Aires, has been battling the novel coronavirus pandemic from the frontlines, armed with medical supplies from China.According to Alejandro Rebollini, associate director of the Dr. Alberto Antranik Eurnekian Hospital, the facility was able to begin preparing for the pandemic as early as January thanks to its proximity to the Ezeiza International Airport, the main gateway to the capital Buenos Aires.As a result, it was also the first Argentine hospital to treat victims of the COVID-19 outbreak."We were the first to receive patients from the airport. We had 170 patients, of which 22 tested positive," Rebollini told Xinhua during a tour of the facility.

Loss of smell and taste is believed to be among the symptoms of COVID-19.To adequately protect staff required "a large number of supplies" the hospital lacked, including personal protective equipment, or PPE, such as hospital-grade face masks, among other things, he noted.

Since then 31,577 people (as of Sunday) tested positive nationwide and 842 people died from the disease.
