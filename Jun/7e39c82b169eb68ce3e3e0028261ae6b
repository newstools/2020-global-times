I am George Floyd, my brothers are George Floyd, and my sisters are George Floyd. I cannot and will not be silent any longer."'Sound of America'For Fredara Hadley, an ethnomusicology professor at the Juilliard School, the black experience has long been the primary driver behind protest music in the US, from abolitionists latching on to spirituals to the 1960s Civil Rights movement powered by jazz, rock, soul and R&B."Black music and black ambitions were allowed to occupy spaces that... the general black population could not," she said. "It served as an ambassador and avatar of blackness in complicated kinds of ways.""You had those musicians writing music that directly responded to and was engaged with whatever was happening in the movement."Kendrick Scott, a New York-based jazz drummer, recently composed an instrumental piece that he mixed with audio of George Floyd's dying words and protesters chanting his name.He said that while writing, he imagined himself on the front lines of the protest, playing his drums in front of the police "with everybody behind me saying his name."Using Floyd's own words was painful, Scott said, but "I wanted people to have that visceral reaction of really feeling that, not just imagining it.""I just wanted to use my instrument, and my voice - which I think is what I do best - in working for change," he added. Hadley said the internet age gives artists and listeners "this direct way of being in dialogue with the moment.""You have this ongoing dialogue which says there is no distance between black musicians and black communities," she explained. "They can be our amplifiers, our chroniclers - help us memorialize what we've lost."Scott agreed, saying black music is one of the US' most vibrant exports."I travel around the world, and I hear black American music everywhere in every corner," he said."Black American music is the sound of America."Newspaper headline: Fight the Power
