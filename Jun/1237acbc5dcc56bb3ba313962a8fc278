Photo: Ministry of Foreign AffairsThe recent groundless accusations made by the US national security advisor Robert O'Brien against China's domestic and foreign policies was full of political lies and exposed the US' deep-rooted Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice, said the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks during a routine Monday press conference in response to questions about the US politician's speech.  The US president's national security advisor reportedly called the Communist Party of China a threat to the sovereignty and the economies of the US and its allies during his speech in the state of Arizona on Wednesday, among other hostile comments against China and the Party. The China-related remakes made by some US politicians go against the facts and violate the basic norms of international relations, Zhao said.Zhao said that the US side has been indifferent to its severe domestic problems, and instead points fingers at other countries, aiming to shift the US people's attention in order to cover up its own problems, adding that the Chinese people and international community are very clear about this.We urge the US side to immediately correct its mistakes and stop making wrong remarks concerning China and actions that undermine China-US relations and mutual trust and cooperation, Zhao said. Global Times
