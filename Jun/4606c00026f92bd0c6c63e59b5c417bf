Reisa Broto Asmoro, a member of the Indonesian National COVID-19 Task Force, said on Sunday that people can go swimming during a "new normal" period of the pandemic."Many people have been asking and waiting for whether or not we can go swimming in pools? Yes," Asmoro was quoted by Kompas.com as saying.However, health protocols should be applied by swimming pool managements and swimmers have to abide by the rules, she said.First, the pool managers have to ensure that the pool contains chlorine disinfectant at 1-10 ppm (parts per million) or bromine at 3-8 ppm, she noted."So, the pH of the waters should reach 7.2 to 8, and this has to be put into notice on information boards daily to make people aware," Asmoro said.Second, the managers should ensure that cleaning and sterilization both on surfaces of the swimming pools and the surrounding areas are carried out regularly, she added."Third, the number of swimming pool users should be restricted to make them keep distances when they are in the pools. Keeping the distance should also be applied in the dressing rooms," she said.The managers should make sure every guest entering the pool area is healthy, Asmoro said, adding that each visitor is required to fill in self-assessment forms on the COVID-19 risks and bring their personal equipment including towels."Also, always put on a mask before and after swimming," she said.
