California's premier desert music fest Coachella, which had been postponed until October because of the coronavirus pandemic, has been canceled for 2020, health officials announced Wednesday.The festival, held annually in Indio, California, was initially scheduled to take place over two weekends in April and was to be headlined by Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott and Frank Ocean.It was moved to October as the deadly COVID-19 virus spread across the US.However, on Wednesday Riverside County Public Health Officer Cameron Kaiser announced that he had decided to scrap the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Stagecoach Country Music Festival."I am concerned as indications grow that COVID-19 could worsen in the fall," said Kaiser. "In addition, events like Coachella and Stagecoach would fall under Governor [Gavin] Newsom's Stage 4, which he has previously stated would require treatments or a vaccine to enter."Given the projected circumstances and potential, I would not be comfortable moving forward."Kaiser said he was aware that his decision would have an impact on many people but stressed that his first priority was to protect and ensure the health of the community.The Coachella festival is one of numerous high-profile events, including South by Southwest and Ultra Music Festival, that have been canceled because of the pandemic.
