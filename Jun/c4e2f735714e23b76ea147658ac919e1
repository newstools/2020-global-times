They personalized the design according to the characteristics of the house owners.Ahmad Salah, a 50-year-old math teacher, deemed that the initiative has led to a cultural and artistic momentum in the village."Even old ladies were helping by providing food and juice to the painters," he said while taking a selfie near his house that was decorated with rulers, pencils and triangles.Ashraf al-Dawdi, governor of Qena, hailed the idea and asked al-Assad to apply it in other villages.He pointed out that the initiative has injected the energy of young people to the village and largely raised awareness about the importance of preserving environmental beauty.Al-Dawdi told Xinhua that he will inspect the work in other villages, and honor al-Assad with 5,000 Egyptian pounds in cash.Since mid-March, the Egyptian government has taken several precautionary measures including the suspension of air traffic, tourism, schools, closure of entertainment and sports activities, and the imposition of night curfew to stem the spread of COVID-19.The country reported 61,130 coronavirus cases and 2,533 deaths in the lastest update of the Health Ministry on Thursday.On Tuesday, the government announced reopening of cafes, restaurants, sports activities and entertainment facilities at 25 percent capacity from June 27 in an attempt to revive the economy.
