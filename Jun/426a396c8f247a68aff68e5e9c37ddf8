With new IPO rules in place, some firms are now qualified to come back, Li said, noting that listing in Hong Kong would help bring these companies closer to their main customers.The atmosphere in the US has become less friendly, while Hong Kong has made many fundamental changes in listing rules, and has become more flexible, Li said.Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com has filed a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The company plans to issue 133 million new shares next week, with an upper price limit of HK$236 ($30.5) per share, media reports said.According to its financial report, JD.com reported net revenue of 146.2 billion yuan ($20.6 billion) in the first quarter amid the coronavirus pandemic, a 20.7 percent increase year-on-year.Net Ease, a Chinese internet giant, is also preparing its IPO in Hong Kong, with its shares set to be listed on Thursday at an upper price limit of HK$126, according to a statement of the company.As one of first generation of internet companies in China, Net Ease was founded in 1997, with business now ranging from e-commerce, online education, video games and others. It has developed into the second largest mobile game company in the world, media reports said.Li Daxiao, the chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, said that individual cases of financial fraud happen in every stock market. On the contrary, many Chinese public firms listing in the US have shown high quality, with favorable growth rates, such as Alibaba and Net Ease.These firms' return could further enhance Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub, while the US stock market, under certain politicians' ill-intended schemes, will suspend its globalization trend, which would be a huge loss to the US in the long run.It is hoped that the US will demonstrate its sincerity in solving the problem and following international common practice in cross-border listing oversight, resolve differences through equal cooperation so as to earnestly protect investors' interests, according to Geng.
