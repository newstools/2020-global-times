But the education authority does not supervise related education, Tang told the Global Times. "Such an education measure lacks systematization and organization, and in practice, it only depends on schools with no supervision," he said.Wong said the Education Bureau has already worked on new materials on the Basic Law and the Constitution, which are expected to be given to students in September.The SAR government doesn't play the role of an onlooker but a gatekeeper in terms of education issues, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Twitter on June 15, where she condemned separatist groups for instigating strikes against the national security law as utilizing students for their political ends.Lam said she expects [government] to make joint effort with families and schools to turn young Hongkongers into "a new generation with a motherland concept, Hong Kong feelings, international vision and social responsibility." The idea of introducing the national security law to Hong Kong students was welcomed on social media in the Chinese mainland, with many netizens saying studying the national security law is crucial in solving the long-standing problems in Hong Kong's education system, which has indirectly led to a weak national identity among local students."Hong Kong must cultivate healthy values and choices in students to prevent them from blindly opposing China," a Weibo user said on Saturday.In May, Lam said the local government would deal with the controversial liberal studies by the end of the year, which was widely considered "biased education" known for inciting anti-mainland sentiment among Hongkongers by setting inappropriate exam questions. This included one which asked whether Japan did more good than harm to China between 1900 and 1945. That question had sparked outrage in Hong Kong and the mainland."It's regrettable that many young people in Hong Kong have little knowledge and recognition of their motherland's history, culture and development, but are keen on mouthing empty Western-style slogans," one mainland netizens said on Weibo.Some suggested Hong Kong invite mainland teachers, including law professors, to improve Hong Kong students' national identity. Chinese mainland teachers in Chinese language studies, history and math have been invited to Hong Kong and Macao since 2008 to participate in local curriculum building and research.Wong said it is critical to train Hong Kong teachers on the national security law for Hong Kong, and suggested sending them to the mainland for training.
