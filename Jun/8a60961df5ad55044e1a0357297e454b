"In this sense, the impact would be structural."US' bullying will only lead high-tech Chinese firms to grow on the path of self-reliance, Ge said, noting that CloudMinds is evaluating the situation to diversify its sourcing of core components.The firm has more than 1,500 patent applications for 5G, artificial intelligence, blockchain and robot intellectual property rights over independent research and development.The Trump administration has been tightening its technology exports to China and is recklessly squeezing Chinese tech firms like Huawei, which has leading advantages in 5G technology. In a new move to further contain Huawei, the US in May moved to block shipments of semiconductors from global chipmakers to the Chinese company.The US' Entity List has in fact achieved little in containing China's high-tech rise, which can be seen in the revenues of Hikvision and iFlytek, two Chinese firms that were added to the US trade blacklist last October. The list included 28 Chinese groups including eight AI tech companies and 20 government entities and universities. Video surveillance equipment provider Hikvision generated total revenues of 57.66 billion yuan ($8.11 billion) in 2019, an increase of 15.69 percent year-on-year, and net profits of 12.41 billion yuan, up 9.36 percent on a yearly basis, according to the company's annual earnings report.Voice recognition champion iFlytek achieved 27.3 percent sales growth in 2019 surpassing 10 billion yuan for the first time.
