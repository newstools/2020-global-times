A man displays fake nuclear barrels at a rally on Sunday to demand the closure of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant, in Fessenheim, France.

That process should be completed by 2023, and the plant is not expected to be fully dismantled before 2040 at the earliest. "We hope, above all, to be the last victims of this witch hunt against nuclear" energy, Fessenheim union representative Anne Laszlo said ahead of the closure that will see about 150 families depart the tiny Alsatian community of 2,500 inhabitants this summer. More will follow, with only 294 people needed on site for the fuel removal process until 2023, and about 60 after that for the final disassembly.By the end of 2017, Fessenheim had over 1,000 employees and service providers on site. There is no legal limit on the life span of French nuclear power stations, but the EDF had envisaged a 40-year ceiling for all second-generation reactors, which use pressurized water technology.France's ASN nuclear safety authority has said reactors can be operated beyond 40 years only if ambitious safety improvements are undertaken.In the 1990s and 2000s, several safety failures were reported at Fessenheim, including an electrical fault, cracks in a reactor cover, a chemistry error, water pollution, a fuel leak, and nonlethal radioactive contamination of workers.In 2007, the same year a Swiss study found that seismic risks in the Alsace region had been underestimated during construction, the ASN denounced a "lack of rigor" in EDF's operation of the plant. Without Fessenheim, France will still have 56 pressurized water reactors at 18 nuclear plants generating some 70 percent of its electricity. Only the US, with 98, has more reactors, but France is by far the world's biggest consumer of nuclear energy.In January, the French government said it would shut 12 more reactors nearing or exceeding the 40-year limit by 2035, when nuclear power should represent just 50 percent of the country's energy mix in favor of renewable sources.At the same time, the EDF is racing to get its first next-generation reactor running by 2022.Newspaper headline: Fessenheim to be retired
