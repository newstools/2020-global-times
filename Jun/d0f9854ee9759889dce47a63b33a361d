Latest available data from the country's statistics' office shows Uganda earned $2 billion from tourism activities in 2017, up from $1.7 billion the previous year.The International Monetary Fund said in May that Uganda's tourism earnings were expected to fall 54 percent in the 2019/20 (July-June) fiscal year, and decline 52 percent in the 2020/21 fiscal year.Museveni said the economy would also lose a substantial chunk of the $1.3 billion sent home each year by Ugandans working abroad as many would be out of work due to the global economic downturn following the pandemic. Uganda has so far recorded 458 cases of COVID-19, with no deaths reported.Stringent measures implemented to curb the virus's spread including bans on both public and private transport, temporarily shutting nearly all businesses and closure of borders has wiped out much of the country's economic activity.The IMF in May nearly halved its forecast for economic growth in Uganda for the financial year ending in June to 3.3 percent and projects 3.7 percent growth in the following fiscal year. In the year ended June 2019, the economy grew 6.5 percent.The EU said on Monday it was giving Uganda $198 million in credit and grants to fund its coronavirus response.Newspaper headline: Uganda to lose $1.6b in tourism earnings as a result of COVID-19
