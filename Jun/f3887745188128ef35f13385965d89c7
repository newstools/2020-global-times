"If the information is not true, there will be legal liability," according to a screenshot of the message.Some people said that they only passed by the market by car or by bus instead of going inside, but they still received the message.As smartphones have become a daily necessity for people, their signal is received by local base stations run by mobile carriers, according to telecom industry analysts Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Wednesday that there is a seamless connection as when the smartphone moves, its signal can be registered at its nearby base station."Based on that, a moving track could be roughly sketched," Xiang said.Apart from the message using big data, facial recognition technology has also been applied in some residential areas in Beijing.The city has expanded its strict closed-off management to all residential communities under the Level II emergency response, according to a press conference on Wednesday. The capital previously required strict lockdown measures in residential communities around areas where infections were found. Chinese facial recognition start-up CloudWalk Technology has established its system since March in a residential area in Beijing's Fengtai district, where the Xinfadi market is located.It can realize automatic recognition of objects, intelligent identification, warning of abnormal behavior, and active push of messages to the local department in charge of epidemic prevention.A spokesperson for CloudWalk told the Global Times that the system is expected to help community management in COVID-19 prevention during the new outbreak.To tackle the current special period of the new outbreak, it is essential to give full play to those high technologies that enhance efficiency, but it is also important to pay attention to personal data protection, said Xiang.
