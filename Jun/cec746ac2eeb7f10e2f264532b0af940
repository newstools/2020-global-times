Kira, a two-and-a-half-year-old tiger, arrived at a zoo in Mexico's northeast in April after her owner could no longer feed her due to the coronavirus-induced economic collapse.

Now they graze in a large enclosure alongside ostriches, giraffes and antelopes."The tiger was reported because they couldn't look after it; but as for the deer... it was an emergency because they didn't have any food or even anyone to look after them, on top of being in a place that was inadequate for the species," said Diego Garcia, Culiacan's director.Mexican zoos have been rescuing illegally trafficked wild animals for years, and others from circuses since a 2015 ban on shows using live animals.In these reserves, experts try to rehabilitate the animals and where possible return them to their natural habitat.However, many are forced to live the rest of their lives in zoos because of the long-term physical damages they've suffered or because they've lost their wild instincts. "When the animals arrive we evaluate them, we rehabilitate them... Many cannot return to the wild because they don't know how to survive, they don't know how to hunt, nor how to defend themselves," said Zazueta.Mexican zoos are struggling, like many businesses, due to lockdown rules imposed over the coronavirus depriving them of vital entrance fees.AZCARM is asking the government for support in food donations.Newspaper headline: Mexican zoo saves animals in danger
