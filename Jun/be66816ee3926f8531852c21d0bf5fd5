The Eiffel Tower, one of the most-visited sites in Paris, will reopen to the public on June 25, more than three months after shuttering in France's coronavirus lockdown, its operators said on Tuesday.The 10-ton metal landmark will emerge from its longest closure since World War II with limited visitor numbers at first, and face masks mandatory for all over the age of 11, said the Eiffel Tower website."At first, only visits by the stairs will be available," and not by elevator, it said, as a means of ensuring a safe distance between people to limit infection risk."To ensure that ascending and descending visitors do not meet in the stairs, ascent will take place from the East pillar and descent by the West pillar," added the website, with a limited number of visitors per floor at a time.The top level will remain closed for now, "since the lifts taking visitors from second to top floor are small. It might reopen during the summer."The statement said ground markings will be put in place to ensure people keep their distance from one another, with "daily cleaning and disinfection of public spaces at the tower."The monument, completed in 1889, receives about 7 million visitors every year.
