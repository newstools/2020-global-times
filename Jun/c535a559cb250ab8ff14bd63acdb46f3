(Photo by Michael Nagle/Xinhua)African countries are pushing for the UN's top rights body to launch a high-level investigation into "systemic racism" and police violence in the US and beyond, according to a draft resolution introduced on Tuesday.The text was the subject of heated discussions in Geneva ahead of a so-called "urgent debate" on the topic at the UN Human Rights Council on Wednesday.The debate was called for following unrest in the US and elsewhere over the death of African-American man George Floyd in police custody.The draft resolution, introduced by the African group, condemns "racially discriminatory and violent practices perpetrated by law enforcement agencies against Africans and people of African descent and structural racism endemic to the criminal justice system, in the United States of America and other parts of the world."The text calls for the establishment of an independent international commission of inquiry (COI) - one of the UN's highest-level probes, generally reserved for major crises like the Syrian conflict. The commission, the text said, should probe "systemic racism, alleged violations of international human rights law and abuses against Africans and of people of African descent in the United States" and elsewhere by law enforcement agencies.The aim, it said, should be "bringing perpetrators to justice."The investigators should also probe "government responses to peaceful protests, including the alleged use of excessive force against protesters, bystanders and journalists," it said.A senior US diplomat in Geneva voiced outrage at the draft resolution."Our transparency, commitment to a free press, and insistence on the right to justice allow the world to see our problems and openly engage on our efforts at finding solutions," said the diplomat."It is countries that hide the truth, violently silence their critics, don't have democratic accountability, and refuse even to recognize fundamental freedoms that merit censure," the diplomat noted.Another senior US official, speaking to AFP in Washington, said the US would take a "hard look" at whether to cooperate on a COI."I think it's a ridiculous idea," he said of the COI, saying the US would want to "impose some ground rules" if it is approved.The draft resolution urges the US government, as well as other relevant countries, to "cooperate fully" with the COI, which would present its findings to the council in a year's time.The rights council's 47 members are due to vote on the resolution following the urgent debate, which is set to begin Wednesday and conclude Thursday morning. George Floyd's brother is expected to address the council by video link.AFP
