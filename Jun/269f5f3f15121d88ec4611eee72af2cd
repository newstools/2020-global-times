Police officers are seen in front of trucks carrying COVID-19 prevention and control materials at a border crossing between China and Vietnam, on May 12, 2020. China's Ministry of Public Security on Tuesday donated COVID-19 prevention and control materials to Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security. These materials, including KN95 masks, disposable surgical masks, medical protective suits, gloves and goggles, were delivered at a border crossing between the two countries. (Chinese Embassy to Vietnam/Handout via Xinhua) Vietnam allowed the entry of Chinese experts, executives and skilled workers after the country initially controlled the COVID-19 pandemic, and now Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam expect entry conditions to be eased.At least 1,000 Chinese managers, skilled technicians and experts have returned to Vietnam, mainly to northern parts such as Hanoi, Haiphong and Bac Giang, a business representative said. "The returned Chinese are required to take nucleic acid tests for COVID-19 at Nanning, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, before entering Vietnam. If they get negative test results, they are allowed to set out from two designated ports - Youyiguan Border Port and Dongxing Port -- that connect the two countries, and take a bus to Vietnam," Li Wei, head of the Business Association of China in Haiphong, a major industrial port city in Vietnam, told the Global Times on Monday. Once arriving at hotels to undergo mandatory 14-day quarantines, the Chinese need to take their body temperatures twice per day as well as nucleic acid tests twice during the two weeks, Li noted."The urgency for the returned Chinese businessmen and high-skilled workers shows Vietnam's hope to save its economy amid the global pandemic…It is necessary for Vietnam to restart production, as well as the operation of key projects and companies with huge investments in the country, as soon as possible," Li said, referring to Chinese company Flat Glass Group and a company that provides products to Victoria's Secret in Haiphong.According to Vietnamese media VnExpress, about 1,000 Chinese citizens will enter Vietnam in June by train to work at an industrial park in the central province of Quang Ngai.However, Chinese SMEs are finding it longer and harder to arrange entry.Li Guilan, director of the Da Nang office at logistics and trading enterprise Hualong Trading Import & Export, has applied for entry passes for two senior executives. "The examination and approval work takes a long time. I hope Vietnam can ease the border entry process while managing virus prevention and control work effectively," Li told the Global Times, expecting the two executives to arrive at Da Nang before July 10. On Thursday, the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the country is in talks with China, South Korea and Japan to resume international flights, provided that the pandemic stops spreading. An insider who declined to be identified told the Global Times that little actual progress has been achieved so far to resume travel between China and Vietnam. Media reports said Vietnam Airlines and Bamboo Airways are getting ready to restart international flights from July and possible destinations include Guangzhou, Seoul and Tokyo.Vietnam has recorded more than 300 COVID-19 cases without a single death, and it has seen no infection clusters for more than two months. Newspaper headline: Chinese SMEs in Vietnam seek easier entry rules for managers, skilled staff
