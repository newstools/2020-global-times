More recently, more than 1,000 Sinopharm employees were voluntarily vaccinated, and the results showed the vaccine is safe and effective, with adverse reactions far lower than other vaccines undergoing trials, according to Sinopharm's official statement on Tuesday.On April 12, the vaccine was approved to enter phase one and phase two clinical trials in Wuzhi county, Central China's Henan Province.Sinopharm has also established the high-level biosafety laboratory for the production of the potential COVID-19 vaccine if it is needed for emergency use.On April 15, Sinopharm's Beijing Institute of Biological Products said it had the capacity to produce 120 million doses of the vaccine a year, while the company's institute in Wuhan will be capable of producing 100 million doses annually.
