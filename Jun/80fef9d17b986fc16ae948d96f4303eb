Pyongyang has already cut off all communication lines with Seoul and even blown off their joint liaison office."The enraged people across the country are actively pushing forward with the preparations for launching a large-scale distribution of leaflets to pour the leaflets of punishment upon those in South Korea," the report said.Earlier this week, a DPRK military spokesman said the DPRK army plans to redeploy troops into the previously-demilitarized zones in the border areas and support the scattering of leaflets into South Korea with military force.Xinhua
