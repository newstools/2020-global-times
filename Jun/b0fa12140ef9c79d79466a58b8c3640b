However, none succeeded, as was the case in the last two years' competitions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted global transport and hindered personnel exchanges, this year's contest was held online and attracted more than 460,000 viewers. Chinese hacking team Tianshu won, followed by teams of 0ops and M01N, both from China as well.

In 2018, CMD passed the online test carried out by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Chinese scientists welcome the global industry players to co-develop the system and build a community of shared future in cyberspace together, Wu noted.
