A separate statement by the agricultural ministry Friday encouraged local authorities to use information technology to control diseases at every stage, from the breeding to the slaughtering of animals.Thanks to the strict control measures, the number of reported cases of African swine fever has been dwindling since late 2018, Han Changfu, minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, noted in May.
