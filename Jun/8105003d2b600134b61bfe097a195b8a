And it’s up to the government to choose whether to exercise that option,” said the report.Canada should be prepared for the consequences of its “choosing sides,” as it seems that China’s government, backed up by public opinion, has made its mind to be firm and tough in response to Canada’s arresting and mistreating Meng since December 2018, an insider told the Global Times on Tuesday. Canada has to be aware that even if the relationship between China and the US improves, Canada could still suffer from the strong sentiment among the Chinese public over the Meng case, the insider said.Chinese people used to “dislike Japan” because of the atrocities the invading Japanese troops committed before 1945, but increasingly, Canada is taking Japan’s place, becoming the most irked nation among Chinese people,  which doesn’t augur well for Canada, the insider said.Meng was arrested by Canadian authorities on December 1, 2018 at the request of the US government over allegation of violating the US’ unilateral sanctions against Iran, sparking widespread indignation among the Chinese public, and bringing China-Canada ties to historical lows. Meng’s case has been closely watched by the entire country – not only the central government but also the public – since Meng's arrest in 2018, stoking waves of strong resentment towards Canada. “I’m totally disappointed in Canada. It has to be held accountable for being a ‘lapdog’ of the US,” netizen “Huanghefeng” posted on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.“It’s more than clear that Canada dare not say yes until the US authorizes it. Drop the illusions and cut ties with it,” another netizen “Xiaohongzhang” said.China has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to Canada’s ruling concerning Meng and has urged the country to immediately release the Chinese citizen. The US and Canada have abused their bilateral extradition treaty and arbitrarily took compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without cause, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said earlier."The Canadian side should immediately correct its mistake, release Meng and ensure her safe return to China at an early date, so as to avoid any continuous harm to China-Canada relations," said Zhao. Last month, a Canadian judge ruled that the extradition case against Meng can proceed, as the case meets the Canadian extradition standard of so-called "double criminality," which also indicates an increased chance for Meng to be extradited to the US. The ruling made bilateral relations "worse than ever," He Weiwen, a former senior trade official and an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, said. Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
