"As we look ahead to our harvest and shipping window this fall, we are optimistic that China will honor the phase one trade agreement to substantially increase imports of US farm products, including soybeans," Sutter said.Sutter holds an optimistic attitude that China will return as a significant buyer of US soybeans in 2020 with a total volume nearing levels seen in previous years, which would be a significant increase compared to recent years.    US soybean exports to China amounted to 12.7 million tons for the 2019-20 marketing year. At this time last year, accumulated US soybean exports to China were at 6.6 million tons- down considerably from pre-trade war levels of around 30 million tons, data from the USSEC showed.Global Times
