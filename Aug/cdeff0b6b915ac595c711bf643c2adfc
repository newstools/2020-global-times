Among them is a painting called A Mountain Called Zhong Nanshan, named after the famous Chinese doctor Zhong Nanshan, who has risen as a prominent figure representing the country's fight against coronavirus.  His latest To See or Not series is based on color test screen, which the artist sees as a test paper for people's different views on the COVID-19 pandemic. "With millions testing positive for the virus, some people chose not to see it while a few did," he said. "It is dangerous to think that way."
