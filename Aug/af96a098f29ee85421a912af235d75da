And the death toll is just over 183,000.The US hit 5 million cases three weeks ago, just 17 days after reaching 4 million, the tracker said.The novel coronavirus has hobbled the US economy, the world's largest, and cast a shadow over US President Donald Trump's once-promising reelection prospects.As Trump faces enormous pressure to curb the contagion, the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, raised the possibility that a still-elusive vaccine might be given emergency approval before the end of trials designed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.The virus has proven a tenacious foe even in nations such as New Zealand and South Korea, which had previously brought their outbreaks largely under control but are now battling new clusters of infections.On the other side of the world, Latin America - the worst-hit region - is still struggling with its first wave, with COVID-19 deaths in Brazil crossing 120,000, second only to the US.Nearly 855,000 people have died of COVID-19 globally, and with no vaccine or effective treatment available yet, governments have been forced to resort to some form of social distancing and lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus.In Iraq, thousands of Shiite pilgrims wearing gloves and masks flooded the holy city of Karbala to mark Ashura, in one of the largest Muslim gatherings since the coronavirus pandemic began.AFP
