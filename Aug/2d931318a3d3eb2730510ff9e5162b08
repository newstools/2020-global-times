About 90 percent of the removed applications were gaming apps, most of them free ones.According to data monitored by qimai.com, the removal peaked at 4:15 am, when Apple took down more than 2,000 applications in one minute. An article from qimai.com showed that most of the applications were removed because they were games not licensed by Chinese authorities. Apple has already sent a warning email to some game developers in China, asking them to enter their approval number and supporting documentation, as well as to submit an update to App Review by Friday, the article showed. A Reuters report said it is not clear why Apple is enforcing these regulations so strictly this year. Apple removed more than 2,500 titles from its app store over the first week of July, the report noted.Many netizens commented on China's social media platform Weibo that they support Apple's move to take down unauthorized applications, but some of them also questioned why Apple had delayed executing Chinese orders about banning unlicensed applications.
