The PLA had not confirmed the launches as of press time.Chinese military observers said it is very dangerous for a US warship to sail near a PLA exercise zone that possibly features anti-ship missile launches, and such a provocative act could risk accidents.The guidance system on anti-ship missiles could mistakenly recognize the unexpected intruding ships as its training target, as such targets are likely designed to simulate potentially hostile ships, and the ship could be unintentionally sunk, analysts warned.This is the second time this week that the US has conducted risky operations in or near a PLA exercise zone.On Tuesday, a U-2 high altitude reconnaissance aircraft trespassed in a no-fly zone that was hosting a live-fire drill by the PLA Northern Theater Command, said Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian in a statement on that day.The U-2 plane could easily have caused misunderstanding and misjudgment, and even triggered an air and maritime accident, Wu said.Chinese military experts said that, as in the warship case, the spy plane could have been mistaken as a training target and shot down.
