Robotic landers and rovers have been touching down on Mars since the 1970s, but when will humanity finally set foot on the Red Planet? Experts say that the technical challenges are nearly resolved, but political considerations make the future of any crewed mission uncertain.

Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump have not led to concrete programs."I have seen maybe 10,000 graphs, charts, proposing various ideas about how to get to Mars, for humans," G. Scott Hubbard, an adjunct professor at Stanford and former senior NASA official, told AFP."But putting the money behind it to make it a reality has not occurred."The mission itself would last two or three years.Today, Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building heavy rockets capable of sending tens of tons toward Mars.Alone and far For the seven-month journey, twenty years of living and working in the International Space Station (ISS) has reassured scientists about the dangers posed by radiation and by weightlessness, such as muscle atrophy.The body does not emerge unscathed, but the risks are deemed acceptable. Then there is the stay on Mars itself, which would last 15 months so that the planets are once more on the same side of the sun.The surface temperature will average -63 C, and though radiation is a factor, suits and shelters exist that would shield astronauts.In case of medical emergencies, distance would make an evacuation impossible.What mishaps should astronauts anticipate? First of all fractures, but plaster casts would often suffice, says Dan Buckland, an engineer and emergency room doctor at Duke University, who is developing a robotic intravenous needle with support from NASA. Diarrhoea, kidney stones and appendicitis are generally treatable, except for 30 percent of appendicitis cases which must be operated and could therefore be fatal. With extensive screening of astronauts' genetics and family history, you can greatly reduce the probability of having a crew member who develops cancer over the course of a three-year mission.

Development is embryonic, but the Artemis program will be a testing ground.Colonies? Musk has proposed colonizing Mars, with a first expedition to build a factory that converts Martian water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into oxygen and methane fuel."Becoming a multiplanet species," he said in a 2017 speech, "beats the hell out of being a single-planet species."Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, likewise advocates for the creation of "new branches of human civilization." That no progress has been made since humanity last walked on the moon in 1972 is, to him, shameful.In the long run, not everyone will return.Newspaper headline: Mission uncertain
