More than half of the ice shelves ringing Antarctica that prevent huge glaciers from sliding into the ocean and lifting sea levels are at risk of crumbling due to climate change, researchers said on Wednesday.

But the air over Antarctica has warmed more than twice that much. One of the consequences has been the appearance of long crevasses parallel to the shoreline - up to tens of meters deep - on the top of ice shelves.As surface ice melts, water pours into these fissures and increases the likelihood of a process called hydrofracturing.When this happens, water - which is heavier than ice - "violently forces the fractures to zip open and cause the shelf to rapidly disintegrate," the researchers said in a statement.The Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed more than any other part of the continent, has shown in dramatic fashion what this can lead to.Major chunks of the Peninsula's Larsen Ice Shelf - which had been stable for more than 10,000 years - disintegrated within days in 1995, and again in 2002. This was followed by the breakup of the nearby Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008 and 2009.Hydrofracturing was almost certainly the main culprit in both cases.Newspaper headline: Meltwater may cause higher sea levels
