People enjoy a movie at a cinema in Shanghai on July 20, the first day that China's film authority allowed theatres in COVID-19 low-risk areas to reopen to the public. Photo: Yang Hui/GTChina's cinemas and performance venues are now able to seat more audience members, as the country gradually relaxes its restrictions on such public venues.The maximum number of audience numbers allowed in performance venues such as theatres and live concerts will increase from 30 percent to 50 percent of the venue's total capacity, starting Friday, according to the guidelines released by China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Wednesday.It is no longer a requirement to ensure a one-meter distance between people in such venues, but audience members still need to sit apart to avoid close contact. Venues will still need to uphold strict epidemic control rules to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus.A staff member from the Shanghai Grand Theatre told the Global Times that they started selling additional tickets from noon on Wednesday for a dance performance called Crested Ibises that will be staged from August 27 to 30, based on the new rules."We are confident that China will further relax the restrictions on theatres, based on our efforts to combat COVID-19. We have made full preparations to welcome more customers with all-round epidemic control measures," she said.Luo Jiajie, manager of Tianshan Cinema in downtown Shanghai, confirmed with the Global Times on Wednesday that they already received approval from the local authority to expand the audience attendance rate in each hall from 30 percent to 50 percent starting on Friday.Moreover, from Friday, audience members will be able to watch their movies in one sitting without a five-minute pause, according to Luo. Previously, if the movie exceeds two hours, it needed to be suspended for five minutes during the screening for ventilation and disinfection. However, the cinemas still have to sell tickets with separating seats, Luo said.Some cinemas in Chengdu will also follow similar rules from Friday, according to a report by Red Star news. The cinemas have been asked to extend the break time between each screening for ventilation and disinfection purposes. Cinemas are also allowed to sell drinks, but drinking and eating are still prohibited in the screening room.The film industry in China was hit hard as cinemas nationwide were closed for as long as 180 days due to the coronavirus. At least 2,300 domestic cinemas were permanently closed in the first two months of 2020, accounting for nearly 20 percent of China's total screening capacity, according to data released by the film industrial association.As of August 9, more than 8,000 cinemas across the country have resumed operations, Beijing Daily reported.
