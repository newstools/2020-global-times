Thus far, only four have been offered the program's highest salary globally.The new recruitment drive comes as the US intensifies its ban on Huawei, which has pushed the Chinese tech firm to ramp up efforts to hire talent before the latest US chip ban comes into effect. Analysts said Huawei may hope that hiring more talent will empower it to surpass other major obstacles amid mounting risks of a blocked chip supply. Ren has on many occasions mentioned an unnamed Russian mathematician who helped the company achieve a technical breakthrough and move from 2G to 3G.Ren visited several top Chinese universities last week, highlighting the importance of developing homegrown talent as the global tech race continues to heat. From Wednesday to Friday, Ren visited Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Fudan University, Southeast University and Nanjing University. He held discussions with experts at each university on industry research cooperation, the development of high-tech talent, fundamental research and technological development.Global Times
