Neil Young is suing Donald Trump's re-election campaign to try to stop the US president playing his songs at campaign rallies, according to a lawsuit posted on the rocker's website.The 74-year-old claims a breach of copyright for the use of "Rockin' In The Free World" and "Devil's Sidewalk," at several Trump events including a recent rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma."[The] plaintiff in good conscience cannot allow his music to be used as a 'theme song' for a divisive, un-American campaign of ignorance and hate," reads the draft filing.The suit, which seeks damages of up to $150,000 for each infringement, is undated but the text indicates Young's attorneys planning to file it with a federal court in New York.Young has repeatedly voiced disdain for Trump's use of his classic hits at rallies, asking him to stop.The Canadian-born musician, now a US citizen, called Trump "a disgrace to my country" earlier in 2019 while coming out in support of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race.Several top artists, including Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Aerosmith, Adele, and the estate of singer Prince have complained about Trump using their songs.
