Through the weekly reports, supervisors are able to keep abreast of employees' progress, and it helps employees monitor their own productivity more effectively.However, on a practical level, weekly reports have become a formality for frontline employees, with many saying that no matter what they write in their weekly reports, few of their managers actually read them. Instead, supervisors were evaluating the quality of employees' work based on the length of the report, which not only wasted time, but piled unnecessary pressure onto employees.The weekly report is one of the reasons so many tech companies' employees work overtime, giving rise to the famed "996" working week: working from 9 am to 9 pm six days a week, including at companies such as Huawei and Alibaba."I work for Alibaba. I finished working at six on Friday because now I don't need to write the weekly report. It feels like heaven," an employee wrote on the social media platform.
