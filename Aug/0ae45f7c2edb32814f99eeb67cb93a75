Singapore began destroying nine tons of seized ivory on Tuesday, the largest such action globally in recent years, including contraband tusks that came from more than 300 African elephants.

Singapore on Tuesday alsoÂ  launched a Centre for Wildlife Forensics to "identify and analyze specimens involved in the illegal wildlife trade."By using DNA analysis and other methods to study the specimens, the center can determine the items' source.
