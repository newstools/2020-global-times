The show's official account on the platform currently has more than 260,000 followers. The show is Chinese streaming giant Tencent Video's first attempt at working with a traditional cultural club to promote traditional Chinese culture. According to show producer Yan Zhihua, many of today's popular shows feature imported singing and dancing culture, but a new trend is emerging, in which more and more young people are turning to China's traditional culture.
