China strongly condemns the move, according to a Foreign Ministry website statement.Vystrcil arrived in Taipei on Sunday with a delegation of 90 people, including the mayor of Prague, on a trip designed to promote business links with Taiwan, Taiwan media reported. Qin stressed that there is only one China in the world, and the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government that represents China, which is recognized by the international community. The one-China principle is the Czech's foreign policy and the political basis for China-Czech ties, said Qin, noting that Vystrcil, as one of the country's leaders, has openly breached the one-China principle which the Czech government has promised to uphold, severely infringing the basic code of international law and relations. China must take necessary actions to safeguard its interests, Qin said.China urges the Czech Republic to take a serious attitude toward China's interests and concerns, and not to underestimate the firm resolve and willingness of the 1.4 billion Chinese people to safeguard the nation's sovereignty and integrity.Qin also urged the Czech Republic to abide by the one-China principle, and avoid bilateral ties from being hurt by the malicious and short-sighted moves of Vystrcil.The Department of European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy to the Czech Republic also lodged solemn representations to the Czech Embassy in China and its Foreign Ministry. Newspaper headline: China summons Czech Ambassador to China to protest over Czech senate speaker's visit to Taiwan Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
