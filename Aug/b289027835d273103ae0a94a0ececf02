When COVID-19 plunged Italy into lockdown, it was decision time at the Verampio power station. The control room, which runs a fleet of hydroelectric plants across the Piedmont region, hard hit by the pandemic, had to be secured to keep the lights on.

In the post-COVID-19 world, many will need to reconsider their technology priorities," said consultancy company McKinsey."Using remote supervision could help grid operators minimize the risk for their workforces while simplifying operations," it said in a report.ResilienceAt Germany's E.ON, Europe's largest operator of energy networks with 1.56 million kilometers of power and gas grids, that message has also sunk in.It has freed up a further 500 million euros ($591 million), on top of a total 13 billion euros it plans to invest over the next three years, mostly in upgrading its energy infrastructure. The company has increased the use of drones by 50 percent and relies more on automated image recognition software for the inspection of high-voltage power lines as a direct consequence of the pandemic, officials told Reuters.E.ON, which recently completed the takeover of Innogy's networks and retail activities, is also banking on virtual reality. At subsidiary Bayernwerk, which operates distribution grids in the German state of Bavaria, E.ON has virtually recreated substations to train staff remotely and provide remote access to partner firms."During the corona crisis, our employees and customers have learned to re-appreciate the advantages of digitalization," E.ON CEO Johannes Teyssen said, adding the group would accelerate digitizing its processes.E.ON is also in the final stages of developing an app similar to Apple's video conferencing service FaceTime that lets technicians help customers fix their smart meters at home, unless the problem is too complex to handle from afar.The creation and use of new technologies is another step in running infrastructure and retail businesses more efficiently and could boost valuations, analysts and consultants say."It builds more resilience in your business when you can operate from multiple locations," said Steve Jennings, head of Energy & Utilities at PwC. "The crisis will accelerate the digital revolution for utilities."

Digital billionsCompanies are investing billions to get big data infrastructure in place that will allow them not only to manage plants and grids efficiently and fast, but also roll out new services and create new revenue streams.They could find some help from plans the European Union has put in place to combat the COVID-19 fallout as its 7-year 1-trillion-euro budget proposal and 750 billion euro recovery plan are geared towards green and digital transitions. Enel has already spent 4.5 billion euros on digitalization in the last three years, and plans to invest a further 2.5 billion euros in 2020-2022 on the "platformisation" of its business. "Platformisation" is the setting up of systems or platforms where service providers and customers can meet to do business. But such drives don't come without risks as the increased need to work remotely also raises the chance of cyberattacks, Leo Simonovich, global head, industrial cyber and digital security at Germany's Siemens, said."Less-reliable internet connections, social engineering attacks against employees and their families, and honest mistakes made in unfamiliar workflows are all new potential risks."Utilities have little choice but to plough on, concerned that they could be challenged by tech giants such as Alphabet's Google or oil majors including BP, which unveiled plans to enter renewables on August 4. "If they don't do it then big data giants like Apple and Google will come in with their apps and redefine the client relationship," said Ingmar Wilhelm, chairman of energy big-data startup Energisme."And COVID[-19] is hammering the message home."Newspaper headline: Power shift
