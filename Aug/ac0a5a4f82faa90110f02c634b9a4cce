"We will do our best to help them, but will not push them to use it," Yu Zhibin, a director with the China Chamber of Commerce for Import & Export of Medicines & Health Products told the Global Times in a previous interview.The SCO's Forum on Traditional Chinese Medicine was held online on July 30, which was the first time the SCO held a meeting on traditional medicine.China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference on July 31 that in the fight against COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has made outstanding contributions, and traditional medicine in various countries has also played a unique and positive role.Â "In recent years, China and SCO countries have conducted exchanges and cooperation in the field of traditional medicine at various levels. Departments in charge of health or traditional medicine in China, Kyrgyzstan, India and others signed cooperation MOUs," said Wang.
