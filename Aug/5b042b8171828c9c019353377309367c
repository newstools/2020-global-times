The Green Climate Fund has promised developing nations it will ramp up efforts to help them tackle climate challenges as they strive to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, approving $879 million in backing for 15 new projects around the world.

The facades of the MA 48 headquarters were lined with green plants, which had positive effects including microclimate, protection of the building fabric from driving rain and dirt deposits, noise protection, and cooling capacity.

But more than 80 green groups issued an open letter ahead of the meeting opposing such funding.They said deforestation had since spiked and countries should not be rewarded for "paper reductions" in carbon emissions calculated from favorable baselines.Liane Schalatek, who leads climate finance work for the Heinrich Böll Foundation North America, said the fund should take a hard look at whether the forest emission reductions it is paying for would be permanent. It should also ensure the funding protects and benefits forest communities and indigenous people, she told Reuters.Other new projects included one for zero-deforestation cocoa production in Cote d'Ivoire,  providing rural villages in Senegal and Afghanistan with solar mini-grids, and conserving biodiversity on Indian Ocean islands. The fund said initiatives like these would create jobs and support a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis.Newspaper headline: Budget allocated to create jobs, offer support
