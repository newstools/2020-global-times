The airport is the first in the country to launch such a service.Unlike ordinary identity screening services that require ID cards, the airport's "One ID" service is based on passengers' facial features, which are screened and recorded and then matched with travel information to build a data profile for each passenger, according to a statement released by the airport Wednesday.The technology service is in strict accordance with the International Air Transport Association's "One ID" concept, with the ultimate goal of accelerating traffic flows by enabling passengers to use only their faces as identification throughout the entire airport process.Doors will open to passengers automatically after the facial verification, which not only ensures safety but also reduces the number of document checks, greatly improving the travel experience, the statement read.The "One ID" service currently covers the main procedures of passenger travel, including self-service check-in, self-service baggage check-in and security checks at Terminal 1 of the airport.However, there are certain limits to the new service. It currently does not include passengers under the age of 12, who will still be required to present ID cards in accordance with corresponding regulations from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the Baiyun airport said.The service is also not yet available at boarding due to the requirements of COVID-19 prevention and control measures.
