The swift measure helped the region bring the contagion under control.  Qiu said they combined Chinese traditional medicine with western medicine and imposed categorized treatment to patients at different severity levels. For early stage patients, Qiu emphasized the use of special immune globulin to contain the virus; and used ventilators, ECOM and other equipment on patients in critical conditions. Xinjiang reported 45 infections Friday, marking seven consecutive days of declining cases and a sharp drop from the day before, when 112 new infections were reported. As of Thursday, Xinjiang has reported 523 infections, with 31 remaining in critical condition.Global Times
