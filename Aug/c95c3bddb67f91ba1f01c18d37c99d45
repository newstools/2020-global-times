I also want to be a hero to save lives in dangerous situation in the future," a Chinese netizen wrote."Do not study medicine unless you have what it takes mentally, have a true passion for medical science and are willing to take on great responsibility and make sacrifices," a young neurosurgeon surnamed Yu from Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning Province, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Yu, who graduated in 2018, said he can understand the enthusiasm of young students, as many saw the heroic images of doctors and nurses during the pandemic and want to emulate them.To mark China's third Medical Workers' Day, 80 doctors across the country were awarded the "Chinese Medical Worker Medal," by the Chinese Medical Doctors Association.Those honored include Tao Yong, an ophthalmologist at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, head of the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital Zhang Dingyu, and Zhang Wenhong, head of the Shanghai COVID-19 medical team.Earlier in August, Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert who identified the SARS virus in 2003 and has been leading China's COVID-19 fight, was awarded the Medal of the Republic, the highest state honor in China.Along with Zhong, China's top medical adviser Zhang Boli, top Chinese vaccine researcher Chen Wei and Zhang Dingyu, head of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, were awarded the titles "People's Hero."
