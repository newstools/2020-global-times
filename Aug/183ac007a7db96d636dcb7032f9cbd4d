More than a dozen environmental groups and one representing northeast Alaskan tribal villages sued the Trump administration on Monday over a plan to open the sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas drilling.

Another lawsuit was filed by Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of groups including the National Audubon Society."Birds can't vote and they can't file a lawsuit - but we can. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment to defend the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and protect America's bird nursery from drilling," Audubon Society President David Yarnold said in a statement.The actions came a week after the Interior Department finalized a plan to issue decades-long leases to oil and gas interests in the refuge before a potential change in US leadership. The Trump administration could hold a lease sale before the end of 2020, officials said on August 17.Regarding the lawsuits, Interior Department spokesman Conner Swanson said the program was mandated by Congress and "leaves 92 percent of the refuge completely off-limits to development."
