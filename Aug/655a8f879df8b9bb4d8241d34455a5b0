A California businessman who tipped prosecutors off to a vast US college admissions cheating and fraud scheme was sentenced on Wednesday to one year in prison after admitting he participated in a stock fraud.

Another defendant, test administrator Niki Williams, agreed to plead guilty on Wednesday. Tobin's lawyer, Brian Kelly, said sending him to prison sends a "terrible message" to would-be cooperating witnesses. Tobin must also pay a $100,000 fine and forfeit $4 million.In court in 2019, assistant US attorney Eric Rosen said the probe stemmed from an investigation into a California man's stock fraud. That man was Tobin, Kelly confirmed in court on Wednesday.
