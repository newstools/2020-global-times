We've already lost 50,000 hectares," firefighter Adrison Parques de Aguilar told AFP.Eighty percent of the Pantanal is typically covered in water in the rainy season. But the region has had a drought in 2020, leaving large swathes of vegetation at risk of going up in flames.The fires are sometimes set by ranchers clearing land to graze cattle.Newspaper headline: Brazil races to contain wetland blazes
