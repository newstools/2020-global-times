He added that the price will be lower than what the China National Biotec Group (CNBG) of SinoPharm had revealed before, which was 1,000 yuan ($144) for two shots.Meanwhile, Yang Xiaoming, chairman at SinoPharm, announced on the same program that more than 20,000 people in the UAE had taken inactivated COVID-19 vaccines developed by China in Phase III clinical trials, which has shown a high level of safety. The efficacy of the vaccine is currently under observation."The Phase III trial in the UAE has no reported cases of side effects so far," Yang said. "Volunteers joined faster than expected and the vaccine was well worth the wait."On Thursday and Friday, the CNBG of SinoPharm signed cooperation agreements on Phase III clinical trials of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines with more countries - Peru, Morocco and Argentina, respectively.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
