For example, TikTok overshadows Facebook in the short-video sector," he said.That TikTok has become the latest target of the US government speaks of the success of the super app in catching the world's eyes backed by its AI technologies and mature operations experience, analysts said. The rapid rise speed of TikTok has aroused Facebook's concern over recent years as it worries if TikTok would finally shake its dominant position.The US' technological supremacy was built on openness and inclusiveness, but now, it has abandoned the key values that contributed to its success over the past decades by sticking to a narrow-minded foreign policy that will hamper its technological improvement in the future, Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based industry analyst, told the Global Times Monday.Unilateralism, attacking and killing whoever is stronger than it only marks the beginning of the fall of the US, Liu said.In recent research, Liu Gang and his team found that Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has climbed higher than domestic internet firms like Alibaba and Tencent, showcasing that core technology innovation is further replacing business model innovation to become key competitiveness.
