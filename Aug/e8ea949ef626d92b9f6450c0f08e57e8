Our system has worked well for years without incident, and I am confident it will continue to ensure strong and dependable access to democracy for the people of our state," said Inslee."The USPS does not just deliver ballots but also medication, paychecks, supplies and other crucial lifelines. To cut back and restrict this service at any time is inexcusable, but during a pandemic it is downright abhorrent," Inslee noted, adding that "the president should be doing less to suppress our votes, and more to suppress the COVID-19 virus."Inslee committed in the statement that he will do everything in his power to help ensure all people in the state have access to the full range of services offered by the USPS, especially their constitutional right to participate in state, local and federal elections.U.S. House Oversight Committee on Sunday called for the chief of the country's postal service to testify before the panel about the cost-cutting overhaul to the agency, which lawmakers worried would sabotage the presidential election later this year with the expected surging of mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic.Trump on Aug. 13 threatened to block the 25-billion-U.S.-dollar funding for the USPS supported by Democrats in a coronavirus relief bill passed in the House in May. Trump said the money would assist mail-in ballots, which he has repeatedly railed against and claimed the method would cause voting fraud.
