This transition will be directed by a body led by a soldier, who will also be head of state," a source in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) delegation told AFP after talks with the junta."The government will also be predominantly composed of soldiers" under the proposal, the source said on condition of anonymity.A junta official confirmed to AFP that "the three-year transition would have a military president and a government mostly composed of soldiers."The source and the official added that the soldiers have agreed to free Keita, who was detained along with other political leaders since the coup on Tuesday, and he would be able to return to his home in the capital Bamako."And if he wants to travel abroad for [medical] treatment, that is not a problem," said the source from ECOWAS.Malian Prime Minister Boubou Cisse, who has been held with Keita at a military base outside the capital where the coup began, would be moved to a secure residence in the city.While the coup was met with international condemnation, thousands of opposition supporters celebrated the president's ouster in the streets of Bamako.The junta has said it "completed the work" of the protesters and has vowed to stage elections "within a reasonable time."However, Mali's neighbors have called for Keita to be reinstated, saying the purpose of the visit by the delegation from the regional ECOWAS bloc was to help "ensure the immediate return of constitutional order."Tuesday's coup has heightened concern over regional stability as Mali's jihadist insurgency now threatens neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso.The ECOWAS talks were set to resume in Bamako on Monday after two days of negotiations with the junta."We have reached a number of agreements but we have not reached agreement on all the issues," Nigerian ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, head of the delegation, told reporters as Sunday's discussions drew to a close.Both the regional delegation and the military officers "want the country to move on" after the coup, he said. "We are just discussing the way forward."AFP
