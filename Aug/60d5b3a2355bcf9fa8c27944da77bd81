"The sheer number of children whose education was completely disrupted for months on end is a global education emergency.""The repercussions could be felt in economies and societies for decades to come," she said in a release accompanying the report.

Then it took into account the availability of curriculum delivered across those platforms during school closures.Even when children have the technology and tools at home, they may not be able to learn remotely through those platforms due to competing factors in the home, including pressure to do chores, being forced to work, a poor environment for learning and lack of support in using the online or broadcast curriculum, the report said.Children from the poorest households and those living in rural areas are by far the most likely to miss out during closures, the report said. Globally, 72 percent of schoolchildren unable to access remote learning live in their countries' poorest households.

Globally, three-quarters of schoolchildren without access live in rural areas.The report highlighted significant inequality across regions, with schoolchildren in sub-Saharan Africa the most affected, where at least half of all students cannot be reached with remote learning.It also noted varying rates of access across age groups, with the youngest students most likely to miss out on remote learning during their most critical years of learning and development.
