Visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (L) touches elbows with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris, France, Aug. 29, 2020. (Xinhua/Gao Jing)Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during his visit in Germany on Monday that anyone who challenges the one-China principle will pay a heavy price, referring to the Czech Senate speaker's Taiwan visit.Wang said Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, noting that to challenge the one-China principle over the Taiwan issue is to make an enemy of 1.4 billion Chinese people and is a violation of international trust and conduct.Calling the speaker of the Czech Republic's Senate Milos Vystrcil's visit to Taiwan a provocation, Wang stressed that the Chinese government and Chinese people will not sit idly by when challenged by the anti-China power behind the politician, and will let him pay a heavy price for the short-sighted move and political speculation.Vystrci started his visit to the island of Taiwan from Sunday, a move that has been opposed not only by the Chinese mainland but also by the Czech president's office.Reuters previously reported that Vystrcil is scheduled to travel to the island with "a trade mission" for six days as the head of a delegation of about 90 political and business leaders.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian made a similar comment at a press conference on Monday. He warned anti-China forces behind the Czech official, saying their scheme is doomed to failure and anyone who challenges the one-China principle will pay a heavy price.Also, the Chinese Embassy in Czech on Saturday expressed strong opposition to the visit. China has always opposed countries with formal diplomatic ties with the mainland conducting official exchanges with the Taiwan region, said the embassy. The embassy urged the Czech side to abide by the one-China principle - there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China - and take concrete actions to safeguard the overall interests of China-Czech relations.The embassy said Vystrcil has seriously interfered in China's internal affairs and infringed on China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, condemning the Czech Senate speaker for ignoring mainstream Czech public opinion and insisted on visiting Taiwan out of personal political calculations.Global  Times
