New Zealand plans to open a virus-free "travel bubble" with the tiny Pacific realm of Cook Islands before the end of 2020, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Monday, while expressing caution about a similar arrangement with Australia.

"Our expectation is that it would be in place before the end of the year," she told reporters, adding that officials were being careful not to move too quickly on the proposal."The last thing anyone wants is to reopen travel, only to have it closed down again because it hasn't been done properly." New Zealand has recorded only 22 coronavirus deaths in a population of 5 million, and marked 100 days since its last case of community transmission on Sunday, while the Cooks declared itself virus-free in mid-April. The economic benefits of the travel bubble are expected to be felt mostly in the Cooks, a popular tourist destination where Ardern estimated 60 percent of pre-virus visitors were from New Zealand. A trans-Tasman bubble with Australia would be far more advantageous to New Zealand's economy, where international tourism screeched to a halt in March.Newspaper headline: NZ looks into Cook Islands travel bubble
