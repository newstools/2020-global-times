However, some students and a solicitor from the Supreme Court of Hong Kong have called their decision a sign of over-reaction. A student at Harvard confirmed with the Global Times on Wednesday that the university is encouraging students to go anonymous in discussions over Hong Kong. However, the student finds the policy to be an over-reaction. "I don't think extreme speeches have been around in our class discussions before. There were different ideas, but all were friendly and legal."Kerry Ratigan, an assistant professor of political science at Amherst College, said she is considering anonymous discussions as an option despite never having adopted this method before. Ratigan denied that her decision is a direct result of the national security law for Hong Kong in an email to the Global Times. Kennedy Wong Ying-ho, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, believes that the US professors are over-reacting. "The national security law never banned academic discussions," Wong told the Global Times on Thursday that students and professors are welcome to discuss and comment on controversies and possibilities of the law and the HKSAR."There is one thing for sure - unless somebody is planning to use academic discussion as a disguise, and instead collude with anti-China activists in Hong Kong to incite social movements that undermine national security, the US universities have nothing to worry about regarding the national security law's influence on academic independence," Wong noted. Media reports hyping and exaggerating the influence and reach of the law are just efforts to demonize the national security law for Hong Kong and smear China, analysts said. A student majoring in international relations at New York University also called certain measures "unnecessary." "People tend to say horrible things when they use anonymous identities, as they do not take responsibility for what they say," he added.
