Kamala Harris. Photo: website US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's naming of Senator Kamala Harris as running mate is seen by Chinese observers as a move to use the first black female vice presidential nominee's background to help him topple President Donald Trump. But based on Harris's previous tough stance on China-related issues, her nomination won't help end the two parties' playing of the China card. Biden announced the news on Tuesday, ending weeks of speculation over who his running mate will be in the November US election.The 55-year-old California senator is the first black woman on a major presidential ticket in US history. Chinese observers noted that her nomination is an apparent move by Biden to win over left-wing and black voters, as social unrest over racial injustice against black Americans has rocked the country for months. Harris once gave herself a Chinese name, He Jinli, which translates to "intricate and beautiful," while the surname means "celebrate."But this should not be misinterpreted as goodwill toward China. The senator has been vocal in her criticisms of China on multiple issues, including Xinjiang and Hong Kong.She criticized China in 2019 for its so-called "reeducation camps" in Xinjiang, and said China failed to "respect the rights and autonomy of Hong Kong's people" and that the Hong Kong government used excessive force "against peaceful protestors," referring to the riots that had engulfed the city for months in 2019. Her latest attack on China includes writing a letter with US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand urging the Trump administration to respond to an "alarming" AP investigation claiming that the Chinese government is taking measures to slash birth rates among Uygurs and other minorities.She jointly launched the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in 2019, and urged several US investigation agencies to probe China's "suppression" of Uygurs.In October 2019, she announced her support for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. "Harris' nomination will only add fuel to the fire of the two parties' competitive playing of the China card, and to acting tough on China during their election campaign," Zhang Tengjun, assistant research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. The observer said that based on the positive response to Biden's decision, team Trump may escalate its "irrational" antagonism against China for the next few months, just to win more attention and attempt to salvage its declining campaign.Trump said he was "a little surprised" that Biden selected Harris as his running mate, saying she had been "nasty" to the former vice-president in primary debates."I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, the most disrespectful of anybody in the US Senate," Trump said.
