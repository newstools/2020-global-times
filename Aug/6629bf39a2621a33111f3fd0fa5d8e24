A California wildfire raging through dry brush and timber east of Los Angeles, forcing thousands of people from their homes, was likely sparked by burning soot from the exhaust of a diesel truck, investigators said on Monday.

One house and two outbuildings were destroyed, CalFire said.By Monday the flames had spread primarily to the east and north into rugged wilderness of the San Bernardino National Forest, and away from densely populated areas, US Forest Service spokesman David Cruz told Reuters. But all evacuation orders remained in effect, he said. The fire resulted from a "vehicle malfunction, specifically, a diesel-fueled vehicle emitting burning carbon from the exhaust system," based on physical evidence and multiple eyewitnesses.Herrera said particles of soot from the unidentified vehicle ignited dry grass along a roadside that grew into the larger fire.Newspaper headline: Diesel truck soot likely sparked major wildfire
