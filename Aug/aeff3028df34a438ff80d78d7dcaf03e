Xinjiang File Photo: VCGBBC on Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are filled with false and farfetched information that has been deliberately pieced together and filled with subjective assumption, said a statement Chinese Foreign Ministry posted on Friday.The Foreign Ministry's Department of Information lodged a solemn representation on Thursday to Beijing-based BBC journalists about the production and broadcasting of false reports related to Xinjiang. The department pointed out that the reports are seriously inaccurate in accusing the Chinese government of "torturing" a large number of Uygurs who are deceitfully held in "internment camps" based on a video made by a drug trafficker and a few text messages. Such reports are full of ideological biases, violate the professional ethics of journalism and seriously mislead the audience and the fake news damages the credibility of the BBC, it said. The department expressed strong opposition to the broadcasting corporation's ideological bias against China and its fabrication of fake news using the excuse of so-called freedom of the press.  "We urge the BBC to take immediate measures to correct its mistakes, discard ideological bias and report China in an objective and impartial manner," said the department in the statement.

The video actually shows the normal transfer of prisoners in the region, according to local authorities.
