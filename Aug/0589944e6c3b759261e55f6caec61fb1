Justice will come late, but it's never absent."Ho was also in hot water after the Yuen Long riot last year, as he was accused by the opposition, including Lam, for "colluding with gangsters" to assault protesters.Ho also faced abuse from the opposition, who were accused of destroying the graves of Ho's parents.After Lam's arrest, Ho said on his social media website that Lam is just the "tip of iceberg," as he pretends to be a "mediator" between police and rioters, but played an important role in Hong Kong's riots. Behind the scenes, "Lam provided a lot of money to those rioters, and it certainly has links with the US, UK and other countries."Ho said that although the national security law for Hong Kong isn't supposed to be retroactive, the Standing Committee of the National People' s Congress has determined that legislators but adhere to their vows and making  false declarations will have legal consequences. According to Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, members of the Legislative Council must swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."Therefore, national security law aside, Lam and other lawmakers were constantly involved in riots and now their arrest  gives authorities reason to revoke their qualification as lawmakers and bar them from participating in legislation works," according to Ho.
