Sixty-four witnesses are expected to be called, and the first was Mohamad Mat Yusop, the police chief of Negeri Sembilan state. Mohamad told the court how he was informed the teen had been reported missing on August 4, 2019, and he immediately ordered a search operation. The following day, he visited the Dusun Resort south of Kuala Lumpur, where the girl disappeared from her room the day after her family had checked in.
