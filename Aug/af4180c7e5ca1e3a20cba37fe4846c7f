A collection of Chinese playwright Cao Yu's works were staged at Beijing's Poly Theater on Friday to mark the 110th birthday of the renowned dramatist. The Chinese playwright became known as a pioneer in the 20th Century Chinese literature with renowned works like Thunderstorm, Sunrise and The Peking Man. Also part of theater troupe Magnificent Culture's effort to revitalize the live performing industry, the event focused on further interpretations of six classics from Cao and his daughter Wan Fang against the background of the COVID-19 epidemic. Six scenes performed by renowned actors like Shi Ke, Yan Guanying and Kong Wei offered audiences a chance to travel back a time before theaters were forced to shut down for nearly six months due to the coronavirus epidemic.  After each performance, Wan hosted a short dialogue with Chinese actor Xiao Zhan on topics covering drama, real life, dreams, honesty and more.  French artist Anaistamo Martane, a producer from Magnificent Culture, also performed the song "Spring" from their 2018 work Ghetto to renew audiences' hopes for the revitalization of the industry.
