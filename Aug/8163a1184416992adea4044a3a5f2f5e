Advertising and in-app purchases accounted for most of the revenues. According to Zhang, TikTok's surging advertising revenues show that the platform is in an early"explosive growth phase," with users growing at a very high speed. He predicted that such growth would also bite into the advertising revenues of US internet giants like Facebook, which could be one of the triggers for the US' ban on the popular app. "For advertisers, the effectiveness of their advertising on platforms like Facebook have more or less reached a bottleneck, while TikTok provides an alternative marketing channel which can help them reach new, younger users at, I presume, lower costs," Zhang told the Global Times. Global Times
