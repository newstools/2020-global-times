China is in second with 227, followed by the UK and India. Unicorns in China and the US collectively account for about 80 percent of the world's total.The list also showed that Beijing is the "capital" of global unicorns, being home to 93, largely outnumbering San Francisco's 68. US-based Sequoia Capital is the world's most successful unicorn investment institution, and has invested in almost a fifth of the world's unicorn companies, according to Hurun.
