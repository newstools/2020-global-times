Tropical forest soil warmed in experiments to levels consistent with end-of-century temperature projections released 55 percent more CO2 than control plots, exposing a previously underestimated source of greenhouse gas emissions, researchers reported on Wednesday.

The Rhone Glacier is protected by special white blankets to prevent it from further melting as a result of global warming.

But climate change has begun to upset that balance, according to a new study, published in Nature."Carbon held in tropical soils is more sensitive to warming than previously recognized," lead author Andrew Nottingham, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh's School of Geosciences, told AFP.  "Even a small increase in respiration from tropical forest soils could have a large effect on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with consequences for global climate."The quantity of carbon cycling each year through soils worldwide is up to 10 times greater than human-generated greenhouse gas emissions.Just a one-percent imbalance - with more carbon going out than in - "would equal about 10 percent of global anthropogenic [man-made] carbon emissions," noted Eric Davidson, a researcher at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.Earth's average surface temperature has risen just over 1 C above preindustrial levels, enough to boost the severity of droughts, heat waves and superstorms made more destructive by rising seas.
