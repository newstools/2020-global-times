One description in Chinese history of the Yellow River, another major river in the country, was "breaching twice in three years, changing course every century." Climate change has generated some extreme weather conditions, and media coverage has created the impression of floods becoming worse year after year, Gao said, noting that in regard to the impact of disasters, China now performs better in disaster relief with more accurate weather forecasts and effective emergency responses. "We can now better predict where and when rain will fall and evacuate people beforehand," Gao said, noting that a "life first" strategy in disaster relief has reduced casualties. China has experienced unusual rainfall in 2020 with a prolonged wet season and heavier precipitation, mainly in southern China. Rain volumes in the Yangtze and Huaihe River basins are the highest since 1961. China also saw a 55 percent drop in flood-related deaths and missing people, and a 65 percent drop in home collapses from five years ago, according to data from the Ministry of Emergency Management. Rapid post-disaster measures, such as draining floods and replanting crops, also help affected farmers to avoid losing their income, analysts said, citing East China's Jiangxi Province as an example.Poyang Lake in Jiangxi experienced severe floods in July, but late-season rice is being planted to offset losses.
