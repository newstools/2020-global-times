Seven virus testing professionals from the Chinese mainland arrived in Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon as the first batch of mainland supportive teams to help contain a worsening spread of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. (Xinhua/Li Gang)China's COVID-19 testing capacity can fully meet domestic demand, authorities said on Wednesday. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), China's daily COVID-19 nucleic acid testing capacity hit 4.84 million at the end of July, with 4,946 institutions and more than 38,000 technical staff now capable of carrying out tests. Nearly 200 million testing kits and 12,000 testing machines have been distributed nationwide. The country's testing capacity has successfully met the demand of 10 million people in Wuhan, Central China's Hunan Province, and 10 million in Beijing. Authorities are working to further enhance testing capacity by training more relevant medical personnel, increasing the production of testing kits and simplifying the marketization process for new products, according to the MIIT official. MIIT plans to install nucleic acid detection facilities in all national tertiary general hospitals, infectious disease hospitals, disease control institutions at all levels, and county-level hospitals by autumn, said the official. At the same time, MIIT will strengthen cooperation among various authorities and forces so that they can be quickly dispatched at an early stage of any future outbreak.Global Times
