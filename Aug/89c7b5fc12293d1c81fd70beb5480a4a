In 1935, he studied aviation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later studied aviation engineering at the California Institute of Technology.The plan to construct a new university of science and technology comes amid the on-going China-US tech war and US' crackdown on Chinese tech companies and talents."China needs top science and technology universities badly as US tightens restrictions on Chinese students and researchers," Zhao Qizheng, former director of China's State Council Information Office and once a nuclear physicist, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Zhao was one of the first students to major in nuclear physics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).USTC was established in 1958 when China's national defense sciences and technologies were extremely short of talents against a backdrop of soured relations between China and the former Soviet Union with Soviet experts pulling out of China, Zhao recalled."Although it took us a few years to nurture talents on our own at that time, we resolutely did so. The current US' crackdown on China's tech talents could also promote China's self-reliance," Zhao said, adding that China needs a top university of science and technology that demands great professors, excellent students, top level teaching and research concepts and sufficient financial support.
