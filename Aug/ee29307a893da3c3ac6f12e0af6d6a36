Therefore, China must develop new industries to replace the traditional engines of economic growth," said Lin Jiang, a professor of economics at Lingnan University College at Sun Yat-sen University. To achieve the goal of developing high-quality industries, China must cooperate with global companies to make up for its technological shortcomings, although the country also should strive to enhance its ability to carry out independent innovation, Lin said. In the speech, Xi underscored the importance of creating new growth levers through vigorous scientific and technological innovations, noting that China would enhance its capability to conduct innovation independently, and achieve rising homegrown breakthroughs in key and core technologies as soon as possible."China needs to introduce overseas investors and companies as a way to stimulate domestic reforms, as the entry of foreign firms would provide momentum as well as guidance to local governments on how to carry out reforms to meet international standards," Lin noted. The economists also noted that China would reform the ways it opens up to the world, aiming for cooperation at higher, deeper levels.  For example, China would evolve from just opening aspects of its economy, such as commodities or the labor market, to amending systems to facilitate opening-up, such as certain financial mechanism reforms in the China (Hainan) Pilot Free Trade Zone."This would likely become the future direction of China's opening up, one of enhancing institutional and systemic openness," Tian said. Newspaper headline: China sticks to opening-up
