 China has called on countries to refrain from selling arms to non-state actors and to stop interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign countries through arms sales at the sixth Conference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which was convened by written procedure on Monday due to the COVID-19 pandemic. China attended the meeting as a state party for the first time and submitted a written statement, in which China made proposals on further strengthening the ATT, which included the above-mentioned remarks, according to a post on the Permanent Mission of China to the UN Office at Geneva’s WeChat public account. China’s ATT statement came after tensions in the Taiwan Straits had been stirred up through frequent arms transactions between the US and the island of Taiwan. An agreement with US arms firm Lockheed Martin to buy 66 F-16V fighter jets signed by Taiwan was announced in mid-August, a move that China firmly opposes. As a countermeasure, China has decided to impose sanctions on Lockheed Martin, the main contractor involved in the latest arms sales plan to Taiwan, as a necessary move to safeguard national interests.In the conference statement, China advocated strengthening the interaction and coordination of conventional arms control mechanisms within the UN framework and actively supported the UN in playing a central role in conventional arms control.China also stressed the importance of enhancing the universality and effectiveness of the treaty and actively carrying out international cooperation and assistance.In phone calls with the conference president Federico Villegas and head of the ATT Secretariat Dumisani Dladla, Li Song, Chinese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for Disarmament Affairs, said China attaches great importance to the humanitarian problems caused by conventional weapons, and takes a prudent and responsible attitude toward military exports and implements strict management.China actively supports the international community in taking the necessary measures to regulate the international arms trade and crack down on illicit arms transfers, said Li, noting that joining the ATT shows China's determination and sincerity in supporting multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind.Villegas and Dladla welcomed China's participation as a state party for the first time and stressed that China's accession is a milestone in the development of ATT, which is of great significance to boosting the international community’s confidence in ATT and further promoting the multilateral arms control process.As an active contributor to world peace and a staunch defender of the international order, China said that it will work with all parties to make greater contributions to the building of a standardized and reasonable arms trade order, according to China’s statement on Monday.China joined the ATT after its envoy to the UN deposited the instrument of accession with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in July. The conference is being held from Monday to this Friday. Global Times
