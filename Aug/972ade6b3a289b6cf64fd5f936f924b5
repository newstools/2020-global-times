"Cool rooms" were set up in municipal buildings, pools opened for late-night swimming and garden parks stayed open by nightfall to help people cool off.France, where temperature average stands at 19.9 degrees for the June-August period, is witnessing more intense and more frequent heatwaves due to climate change.The heatwave's frequencies would double by 2050 unless concrete and urgent acts are taken to fight global warming, according to French climate scientists.
