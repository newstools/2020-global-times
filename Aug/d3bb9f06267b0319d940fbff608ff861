It's totally democratic," he explained.Delfin, a 31-year-old Mexican artist, said painting on the streets of the Brazilian cultural capital was a dream come true.Her 182-square-meter work depicts a man and woman's face in black and white with near-photographic realism."Sao Paulo is obviously a super important place in the art world, especially street art and public art. I had always wanted to work here, and doing it in such a central place where lots of people can see is really important," she said.Brazil is the second-worst-hit country in the pandemic, after the US, with more than 3.3 million cases and more than 108,000 deaths.Sao Paulo State, the hardest hit, accounts for a quarter of the death toll.The artists all depicted their reflections on the pandemic in their work.Delfin said she wanted hers to send "a message of hope, that things will get back on track.""I can see loads of people looking at it out their windows," she said.
