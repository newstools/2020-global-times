China and India have held several rounds of senior military-level talks and agreed to disengage the frontline troops following the border clash in June. As two neighboring countries, both home to populations of more than 1 billion, the development of China-India relations benefits not only the two countries and two peoples, but also contributes to stability and the peace and prosperity of the region as well as the world, Zhao said.“It is the right choice for the two countries to have mutual respect and to support each other, which is in line with the two sides’ long term interests,” Zhao said.China is willing to work with India to enhance mutual political trust, properly manage differences, strengthen pragmatic cooperation, and safeguard the overall development of bilateral ties, he noted.Global Times
