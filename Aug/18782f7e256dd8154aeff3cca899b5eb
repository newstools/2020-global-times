Of the 1,793 prisoners, more than 1,025 had tried to escape and been recaptured and 430 had remained inside."The rest are missing," he said.A defense ministry statement said all 10 attackers had been killed by Afghan security forces, though a provincial council member and a witness inside the prison told Reuters the number was likely around 30.Reuters
