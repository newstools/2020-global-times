Moon's government has said it respects the ruling and will seek a "smooth resolution" with Japan."The door for consultations is still wide open," Moon said in his Saturday speech.Later in the day, Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako attended a national ceremony to mark the anniversary, which had been scaled back because of coronavirus.Naruhito was born well after the conflict and has spoken of the need to "correctly" remember World War II, without downplaying Japan's early-20th-century militarism.It was his grandfather Hirohito who announced Japan's defeat on August 15, 1945, in an unprecedented radio address that was the first time the country's citizens had heard the monarch's voice.Reuters
