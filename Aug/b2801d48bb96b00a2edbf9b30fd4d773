The Supreme Court of British Columbia in Canada held a hearing last week on whether or not the judicial process was abused when the US requested the extradition of Meng from Canada and on whether information should be further released about Meng's arrest.In documents filed with the court on August 17, Meng’s defense team argued that Meng "reasonably believes that many documents are the subject of excessive redactions and overly broad claims of privilege. It is likely that there is redacted information that is relevant to her abuse of process allegations," according to media reports.Meng's defense team is now targeting the alleged abuse of process - one of the major controversial points in the extradition case.The Chinese Foreign Ministry has warned multiple times that the longer the case against Meng continues, the deeper the damage will be done to relations with China. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Canada, Wang said. “50 years ago, Canadian leaders removed external interference and withstood pressure from all parties to achieve the establishment of diplomatic relations with China, which was the correct step,” he added. Global Times
