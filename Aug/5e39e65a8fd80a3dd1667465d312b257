Some protesters then launched fireworks and more bottles at officers.Later, some protesters smashed streetlights and set fire to a nearby building.The clashes came hours after some two dozen police faced off against hundreds of demonstrators chanting "No justice, no peace" and "Say his name - Jacob Blake."Blake, 29, was airlifted to hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition, but local media reported Monday afternoon that his family said he was out of surgery and improving. Kenosha County, on the shores of Lake Michigan, has declared a curfew from 8 pm until 7 am Tuesday, after protesters set alight several city vehicles and damaged the county courthouse late Sunday."The public needs to be off the streets for their safety," the county sheriff said.Wisconsin governor Tony Evers said he was sending 125 members of the national guard to the city to maintain order Monday night.He urged protesters to be peaceful, adding: "We must see the trauma, fear and exhaustion of being black in our state and our country."One couple, who only gave their names as Michelle and Kalvin, had brought their seven-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son with them."I want my kids to see how change happens and am here so nothing like this ever happens to them," Michelle said.AFP
