(Xinhua/Rahel Patrasso)The Chinese Embassy in Brazil announced on Thursday that all travelers flying to China from Brazil — including those transiting via Brazil — must provide nucleic acid test results for COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of their boarding, starting from Sep 7. The announcement comes as the country is reporting rising numbers of confirmed cases and possible cases of re-infection.To board an aircraft, Chinese passengers must apply for a green Health Code with the "HS" mark, which can be granted after returning negative nucleic acid test results. Rapid testing, serum testing and other testing methods are not recognized, the embassy said. The green health code with an aircraft logo, generated by a daily report of a person's health status for 14 consecutive days, is no longer applicable.Chinese nationals can report their health condition and upload their test results via the WeChat mini program within 24 hours of receiving the negative test result to receive the green health code. Non-Chinese passengers, on the other hand, need to apply for the Health Declaration Form for boarding with a negative nucleic acid test, which can be done by emailing the relevant materials to the appropriate embassy or consulate. All passengers are reminded to make sure their code or health declaration is valid when transiting in some countries that might require such information.Brazil currently has the second largest number of confirmed cases and deaths. As of August 26, local time, confirmed cases in Brazil is expected to soon reach 3.72 million, while 117,665 deaths have so far been reported.Brazil has so far reported eight possible re-infected cases of COVID19, one in Rio de Janeiro and seven in Sao Paolo, following re-infected cases reported in the Netherlands, Belgium and Hong Kong during the past days, raising concerns about effective treatment and epidemic control.
