The pandemic is causing uncertainties for migrants to the US with growing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in this country and the Trump administration's unfriendly visa policies, observers said.The pandemic has likely upset plans of many migrants, preventing them reaching destination countries. Lu Yixi, associate professor at the Institute of Development Studies under Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, shared a survey she conducted on Chinese returnees in Southwest China's Sichuan Province in June. "Twenty-three percent of them have changed their migration plans due to the pandemic," Lu said.The pandemic has also largely affected overseas students, Shen Wei, associate vice-chancellor of Deakin University in Melbourne, said at the webinar. "The current border closures and travel bans has prevented nearly 20 percent of our international students from entering Australia," Shen said.Shen called on authorities in destination to create more flexible immigration policies amid the pandemic, such as offering safe corridors for international students, and protecting the lives, health and basic rights of migrant workers.No country can defeat the pandemic alone, said IOM China Chief of Mission Giuseppe Crocetti who hosted Tuesday's webinar. In the long run, the exclusion (of migrants in the fight against the virus) is costly, whereas the inclusion will pay off for everyone, Crocetti said."No one is safe until everyone is safe," he added.
