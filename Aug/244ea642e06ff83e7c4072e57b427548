A makeshift hospital at the AsiaWorld-Expo, a venue near the Hong Kong International Airport, began receiving COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms since Saturday afternoon, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority (HA) said. (Xinhua/Wu Xiaochu) Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung revealed on Sunday that, in addition to assisting with the city's makeshift hospital at the AsiaWorld Expo, the central government will help build a completely new hospital in Hong Kong to help curb the spread of COVID-19.HK SAR government is currently scouting the proper location for the hospital, but it has not yet been announced how many people from the Chinese mainland will get involved in its construction, Cheung said.Hong Kong media said that the new hospital may be built on a site near the AsiaWorld Expo, in a location originally earmarked for a second-phase of expo construction.Covering an area of 53,000 square meters, the second-phase project that was proposed in 2018 by the SAR government has yet to be constructed, reports said.The new hospital in Hong Kong resembles the Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals built in Wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak. The thousand-bed Huoshenshan hospital was built in just 10 days, and covered an area of almost 25,000 square meters. Six experts from Wuhan who were previously involved in building makeshift hospitals - including a hospital dean, disease infection specialists, nurses, and design experts - will all provide technical support to the new hospital in Hong Kong, Wenweipo reported on Sunday.
