Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian is making remarks at a press briefing on Feb. 24. Photo: website of the Ministry of Foreign AffairsChina's Foreign Ministry suggested the US take a look at a poll on China-US relations launched by the Global Times, which showed that more than 90 percent of respondents hold a negative impression of the US, while 97 percent support China's countermeasures against US provocations. "This is a fine poll that the US should check," ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at Tuesday's routine press conference. Some 98 percent recognized that American attacks on the Communist Party of China aim to alienate the Party from the people, destroy Chinese solidarity and conduct ideological mobilization for a new cold war against China, according to the poll.Analysts commented that the poll showed a Chinese consensus that the US is the biggest troublemaker, and hampers other countries' sovereignty in the name of democracy and freedom. Few believe that the US cares about democracy and human rights in China, and the consensus encouraged Chinese people to firmly support government policies regarding the US. "Some Americans should see that Chinese people clearly understand their vicious intentions of jeopardizing China-US relations and stirring up confrontation," Zhao said, noting that the US perversion of justice will only make Chinese people more united and patriotic. The US should recognize the situation and reality, abandon its illusion of changing China in accordance with American needs, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs and cracking down on China's justified rights, Zhao said. The US should work together with China to bring bilateral relations back to the right track of coordination, cooperation and stability, he said. Global Times
