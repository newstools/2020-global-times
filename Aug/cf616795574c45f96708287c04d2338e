After 19 days out at sea, it reportedly returned to the shipyard on Sunday.Military experts told the Global Times that the first sea trial likely tested its propulsion system among other major systems, including navigation and communication systems.A 19-day sea trial is considered a lengthy one, and its success showed the ship's rapid outfitting progress, analysts said.It usually takes a new warship a year or two to formally join military service after its first sea trial, military analysts said. This means the first Type 075 will likely be commissioned into the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy in 2021 or 2022, they said.The first Type 075 was launched in September 2019. A second ship of its class was launched in April this year.Global Times
