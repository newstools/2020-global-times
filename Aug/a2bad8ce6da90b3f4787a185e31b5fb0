"Only by doing so can a sound environment for the healthy and orderly operation of the global capital market be created."China has never prohibited or prevented relevant accounting firms from offering audit work papers to overseas regulators, the CSRC said.The country's securities authorities have provided the audit work papers of several U.S.-listed Chinese companies to the U.S. securities authorities, as mentioned in the U.S. report, it said.The exchange of information including that of audit work papers should be conducted through regulatory cooperation channels, which is an internationally accepted common practice, the CSRC said.
