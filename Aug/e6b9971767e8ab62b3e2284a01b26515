Cases, too, are falling, which remains hard to interpret, given the testing decline -- but fewer people are now in the hospital with COVID-19 than last week," said a new report of The COVID Tracking Project.This is the second week in a row that hospitalizations seem to have dropped, which suggests that infections may be declining independently of testing reductions, according to the report.The number of COVID-19 cases in the United States topped 5.29 million as of Friday afternoon with more than 168,100 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
