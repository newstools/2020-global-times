China India Photo: GTChina strongly opposes the illegal crossing by Indian troops of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on Monday, which is a severe violation of the consensus reached at the multilevel talks between the two countries previously, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Western Theater Command said on Monday night. Such blatant provocations result in increased tensions along the border, and the Chinese side urges India to withdraw its troops that crossed the line, strictly restrain its frontline forces and effectively follow its commitments, the PLA Western Theater Command noted. On Monday, Indian troops illegally crossed the LAC again at the southern bank of Pangong Tso and mountainous border areas, inciting provocations with such a move seriously intruding upon China's territorial sovereignty while undermining peace and stability along the border between China and India. The official statement was made after Indian media again hyped up fresh clashes with China, accusing the PLA of "provocative movements." By citing the Indian defense ministry on Monday, Indian media reports said the PLA troops "violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements in the ongoing standoff in eastern Ladakh, and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo."When asked about the information released by the Indian military that it has taken action to stop Chinese activities in the Ladakh area, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, refuted such claims, saying that Chinese border troops have always strictly observed the LAC and have never crossed the line. The border troops of the two countries have been in communication over territorial issues, he said.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
