They concluded that blood neuro-exosomal synaptic proteins can be used as a biomarker to predict Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment symptoms up to seven years before impacts become more serious. Jia told media that the finding has helped win time for the early invention of the disease, adding to the efficiency of treatment and thereby reducing the number of cases. China has the largest number of patients with Alzheimer’s disease in the world and the fastest growth rate. The number of patients is more than 10 million and it is estimated to reach 40 million by the year 2050, according to data from China’s first report on Alzheimer’s disease patients’ living situation, released in January. Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most prominent diseases affecting seniors’ health and quality of life, but there is still no effective medicine for it, and many potential medicines fail as most patients are in the later periods of their lives. Early prevention of the disease may delay the symptoms, according to Science and Technology Daily.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
