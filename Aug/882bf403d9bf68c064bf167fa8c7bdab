Dalian Photo:VCGThe possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in Dalian being caused by domestic cases can be primarily ruled out, as the cases have been found to be unrelated to those discovered in Beijing and Northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, local authorities said Monday. Zhao Zuowei, director of the Dalian health commission, said at a press conference Monday that gene sequencing results showed that the virus which caused the Dalian outbreak is different from that circulating in China. The outbreak has been proven to be unrelated to that in Urumqi, Beijing, Harbin or Suifenhe in Northeast China' Heilongjiang, Zhao said.The possibility of this outbreak being caused by imported cases cannot be ruled out, Zhao said, noting that experts are working on tracing the source of the virus that caused this outbreak.According to the Dalian health authority, the city discovered eight local COVID-19 cases on Sunday, pushing the total cases discovered since July 22 to 87. This outbreak likely started in the Dalian Kaiyang seafood company’s processing workshops on July 9 and rapidly spread among the workshops before spreading to the outside, according to Zhao. Gene sequencing results showed that the virus discovered among cases inside and outside the company are highly homologous, Zhao noted. To date, more than 60 employees from the workshops have been confirmed to be infected, showing a prevalence rate of 61.9 percent, Zhao said. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
