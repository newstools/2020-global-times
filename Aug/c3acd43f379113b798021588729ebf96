"Well it's something that if they don't treat us right I would certainly, I would certainly do that," Trump said.Zhao stressed that some American politicians' repeated claims that the US has been losing in its dealings with China and other fallacies about China are just made out of ideological bias. "Their hyping of a 'China threat' and advocating a cold war, as well their zero-sum games, are neither based on facts nor do they respect history," Zhao said, noting that they are reversing the wheels of history.Zhao said that the relationship of the development of the two countries is not an either-or concept, and therefore it's unnecessary for the two to repel one another. "Instead of decoupling, China and the US should cooperate to boost the development of their relationship and shoulder their responsibilities to the world," he said.He pointed out that every country needs to resume normal economic activities and maintain the stability of domestic industrial and supply chains, during which process no country is immune from globalization. Countries can only survive this difficult period by helping each other, he said.Zhao said that China's policy stance on developing China-US relations has been consistent, with a high degree of stability and continuity. At the same time, China is also ready to face some setbacks in China-US relations."We urge some politicians in the US to correct their mistakes, view and handle China-US relations in a correct way, and stop harming China's interests and smearing and attacking China so as to get China-US relations back to the right track as early as possible," Zhao said.Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi said at a press conference on Monday in Beihai, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, that some US politicians' decoupling rhetoric is neither feasible nor reasonable, stressing that the political trick neglects the US' own development needs and harms the interests of common people, and thus it is doomed to be a dead end."The integration of every economy is a natural result of the development of the international division of labor, and forcing the separation of cooperation between countries goes against market economy principles and enterprises' intentions," Wang said, noting that this tactic will turn into a boomerang and harm the US itself.As two open economies and supporters of globalization and the multilateral trade system, China and Europe should not let decoupling rhetoric disrupt the normal operations of global industry and supply chains, let alone unilateral bullying that harms normal international economic exchanges.
