Experts say the opening of the route is driven by a need for bilateral trade and cooperation and predict it will play a positive role in the resumption of business for both the US and China sides.The route conducted by the Boeing 747 all-cargo aircraft is scheduled to run three flights per week, helping Wuhan airport further improve its port functions, become more attractive to the global electronics industry, and help turn the city into an aviation logistics hub, according to a report that Wuhan Tianhe International Airport sent to the Global Times on Monday.The goods exported on this route are mainly electronic products, machinery parts and spare parts, and cross-border e-commerce goods, the report said.The launch of the new cargo route is in line with the Chinese government's three-year action plan to use 10 projects to strengthen Hubei Province after the successful containment of the COVID-19 epidemic. The action plan was first issued on August 11, and is scheduled to take three years to complete.As outlined in the plan, Hubei will focus on development in a number of areas including transportation, energy, new infrastructure, cold chain logistics and the upgrading of industrial parks.Until now, some 4,572 corresponding projects have been listed, with an estimated total investment of about 2.3 trillion ($3,314 billion) yuan.Among them, connecting Wuhan with the world is one of the more important strategies, because it ties in with the efforts to accelerate the development and opening-up of Hubei Province, and will also play a positive role in China-US trade driven by US demand."America's economy is now shifting to the Southwest, where the aerospace and manufacturing needs of Texas are well served by the manufacturing abilities of Wuhan," Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times Monday.The opening of the route between Wuhan and Dallas comes after the US shut down China's consulate in Houston, bringing relations between the two countries to a dangerous low point.However, Tian said that the opening of the route will undoubtedly have a positive impact on current China-US trade and economic relations.By the end of July, Wuhan Tianhe Airport had around 30 international freight traffic hubs. All cargo routes from Wuhan to Liege, Belgium and Chicago, US, have been restored, as well as regular passenger cargo routes to Hong Kong SAR, South Korea, Manila and Singapore, according to a governmental report.
