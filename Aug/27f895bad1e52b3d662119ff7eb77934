Egyptian lawmakers are pushing for a new law to protect the identity of women coming forward to report sexual abuse and assault as the nation's MeToo movement picks up speed.

But in 2020 there has been a spike in reporting about cases of sexual assault since early July, when an Instagram page revealed the case of a university student who is accused of sexually assaulting and blackmailing multiple women.The student was arrested and the case is currently being investigated by the authorities.Within five days of the case being disclosed, the National Council for Women said that it had received 400 complaints, mainly about violence carried out against women.Lawmaker Magda Nasr said the new law to allow anonymity of sexual abuse survivors will be a game changer for women in Egypt as it will give greater protection to report such cases."There is an apparent political will to protect women rights and attempt to reduce as much as possible violence against women," she told Reuters.The same Instagram account has also exposed a gang rape said to involve six men from wealthy and powerful families that prosecutors are currently investigating.Since then Egyptian actresses have spoken up against how they were subjected to sexual assault.One actress, Rania Youssef, who faced charges in 2018 that were later dropped after wearing a see-through outfit to a film festival, published photos of those responsible on social media.In other cases, two other human rights activists were accused of sexual assault against female employees and a Coptic priest was defrocked on sexual assault allegations."It is a moment where women can have more gains in their fight against sexual abuse," said lawyer Entessar El-Saeed, executive director of the Cairo Foundation for Development and Law.Newspaper headline: Women speak up on sexual assault
