The threat that a massive chunk of glacier loosened by soaring temperatures could collapse near an alpine resort on the Italian side of the Mont Blanc mountain range has slightly eased, a local mayor said Saturday.Security measures around the danger area were being "gradually relaxed," local officials said.Climate change has been increasingly melting the world's glaciers, creating a new danger for the town of Courmayeur, a resort community in Italy's Aosta Valley region, near the French border.The town was put on high alert on Wednesday as a block of ice estimated at about 500,000 cubic meters - the size of the Milan cathedral, one official said - from the Planpincieux glacier risked falling and threatening homes.A "red zone" at the base of the slope was also evacuated, with 20 residents and around 55 holidaymakers moved from the area. Courmayeur Mayor Stefano Miserocchi said Saturday that things were looking up.

But Miserocchi said Saturday that "the circulation of water under the glacier has resumed... it was this point that worried us a lot."During a helicopter flypast, an AFP reporter saw a gaping chasm on the lower part of the Planpincieux, from which two cascades of water flowed towards the valley, as it hung from the mountainside like a gigantic block of grey polystyrene.Newspaper headline: Threat of ice fall eases
