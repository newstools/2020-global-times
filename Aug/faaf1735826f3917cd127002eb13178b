German leaders Sunday condemned the "unacceptable" attempt by protesters to storm the Reichstag parliament building during a mass rally against coronavirus restrictions.Some of the protesters on Saturday carried the flag of the former German Reich which was used until the end of the First World War."Flags from the Reich and far-right profanity in front of the German parliament are an unacceptable attack on the heart of our democracy," President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Instagram. "We will never accept this."Police said some 38,000 people, double the number expected, had gathered in Berlin on Saturday to protest restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, such as the wearing of masks and social distancing.Around 2,000 protesters gathered again not far from the Reichstag on Sunday although police said they were quickly dispersed after police carried out "several identity checks."AFP
