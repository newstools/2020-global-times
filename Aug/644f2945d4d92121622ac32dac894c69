The Chinese Embassy in India on Tuesday urged the Indian side to avoid politicizing normal cooperation and maintain the healthy development of cultural exchanges between the two countries, after India vowed to review China-India high education cooperative projects including the Confucius Institutes.All Confucius Institutes were established by the Chinese and Indian universities after signing legally binding cooperation agreements in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, friendly consultation, equality and mutual benefit, and on the premise that the Indian side applied voluntarily and met the conditions for running the Institute, said spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India, Counselor Ji Rong, according to a report on the embassy's website on Tuesday.With increasingly close economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and India, the demand for Chinese language teaching in India is growing. China-India cooperation in the Confucius Institute project has been carried out for more than 10 years.The school-running mode of Confucius Institutes has always been "foreign side mainly managing, Chinese side assisting and both sides raising funds jointly," the spokesperson said. Over the years, Confucius Institutes have played an important role in promoting Chinese language teaching in India and China-India people-to-people and cultural exchanges. This has been generally recognized by the Indian education community.We hope the relevant Indian parties can treat Confucius Institutes and China-India higher education cooperation in an objective and fair manner, avoid politicizing normal cooperation, and maintain healthy and stable development of China-India people-to-people and cultural exchanges, said the spokesperson.India's education ministry has decided to review in the coming week the establishment of Confucius Institutes in association with seven local colleges and universities, and it also plans to review 54 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed between prestigious educational institutions, including the Indian Institute of Technology and Banaras Hindu University with Chinese institutions, the Hindustan Times reported on Sunday.Global Times
