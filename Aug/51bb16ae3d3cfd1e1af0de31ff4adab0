Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, Italy's second generation of immigrants is renewing the fight for automatic citizenship in a land where migration is at the heart of the political debate.

They claim their fight for citizenship is also weighed down by anti-immigrant sentiment at home, fomented by the far-right League party, which left government in 2019 after only a year in power.Of the 5.3 million foreigners living in Italy in 2019, around 1.3 million were under 18 and three quarters of those were born in the country.Among those most affected are the children of Albanians, Moroccans, Chinese, Indians and Pakistani immigrants. Italian/not Italian Maiga, 28, cofounded Italiani Senza Cittadinanza, or Italians Without Citizenship, in 2016 to help second-generation migrants - known as the G2 - become Italian.Under a 1992 law, anyone born in Italy can apply for citizenship at the age of 18, on condition of having legally lived here "without interruption." However, the process must be launched before they turn 19. Up until that point, they are given residence permits.If that window is missed, people can also become a citizen on the grounds of legal residency for a decade and on the condition of a minimum income of 8,500 euros ($10,000) a year over three years.Nevertheless, the process can take a long time and involves complicated paperwork."I applied when I was 18. I had to wait for four years before getting my papers," Marwa Mahmoud, 35, told AFP.  "I know what it's like to live as an Italian in everything but in law," Egyptian-born Mahmoud said.Mahmoud and others also worry the ongoing migrant crisis - in which hundreds continue to arrive on Italy's shores every day - is pushing their own struggle further down the agenda.The numbers of people arriving in this way have risen by nearly 150 percent from the start of August 2019 to the end of July, the majority coming by boat from Tunisia, Italy's interior ministry said on August 15. "Our situation is being passed over in silence," Mahmoud lamented."Since Italy started getting embroiled in the migrant crisis it's like we're starting at zero again," she said, adding that Italians "tend to put everyone in the same basket.""But the situation of an unaccompanied minor who arrived yesterday is not comparable with that of an immigrant child born and raised here," she said.

But "it's not a priority," said Giuseppe Brescia, a Five Star deputy, who heads parliament's committee on constitutional affairs.The G2 movement now plans to hold a demonstration on September 19 in the hope of advancing the cause of what it calls Italy's "forgotten noncitizens."Newspaper headline: Birthright battle
