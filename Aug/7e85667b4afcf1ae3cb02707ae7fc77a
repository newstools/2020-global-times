The misjudgments of  US politicians will come at the expense of US businesses.The US has become the country where Chinese consumer preference for products and brands has dropped with a rating of 63.7 percent, a Global Times survey in July showed.However, the rising disapproval of US products and strong support for retaliation against the US among consumers doesn't mean the Chinese government will take measures against US businesses unless they are participating in actions such as arms sale to Taiwan.
