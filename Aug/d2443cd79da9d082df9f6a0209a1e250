All personnel who may have touched the product in question have received nucleic acid tests, according to the local authority. The results for the personnel were negative, and all the related products in stock were sealed off, while products that had already been sold were traced and handled by the relevant authority. This was the latest case of coronavirus found on the surface of frozen imported products, after the virus was found on packaging of frozen imported seafood from South American countries including Ecuador. Samples taken from the packaging of imported frozen shrimps from Ecuador in a restaurant in Wuhu, East China's Anhui Province, tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, a day after the virus was detected on the outer packaging of imported frozen seafood products in Yantai, a coastal city in East China's Shandong Province. Since the beginning of July, seven cities in China have reported detecting the virus on packaging of frozen seafood, according to media reports. Some health experts explained that the reason for this is that the COVID-19 epidemic is still severely affecting many countries. Procedures for packing frozen seafood means it is more likely to be contaminated, and the products are usually stocked in a low temperature environment, which may give the virus a more conducive environment in which to exist, some experts said. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
