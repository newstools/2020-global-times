As our bodies convert food into energy, they produce debris that accumulates as we age. New research shows that one of these metabolic throwaways plays a potentially deadly role in the development of cancer.

The key seems to be in a sort of reprogramming that "switches on" a gene called SOX4. Prior research has shown SOX4 encourages cancer cells to become more aggressive and prone to metastasis. To test whether it was indeed SOX4 that was altering the qualities of the cancer cells, the team blocked expression of the gene, and found that MMA is not of the same effect.Blocking SOX4 stopped the process by which the cancer cells were able to resist two cancer treatments. "This discovery is the beginning of many investigations in many different directions," said John Blenis, a professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine, who led the research."But our hope overall is that we'll be able eventually to develop therapies to reduce MMA levels and thereby reduce cancer mortality," Blenis said in a statement issued by Weill Cornell Medicine.
