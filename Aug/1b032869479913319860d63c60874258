Chinese Ambassador Tang Songgen walks on the backs of Kiribati men in a traditional welcoming ceremony. Photo: FacebookThe misrepresentation of a photo of the Chinese ambassador to Kiribati walking across the backs of locals in a traditional welcoming ceremony was refuted by local officials, and criticized by experts as a move intended to damage China’s image in the island.The image drew criticism from some Western politicians and Twitter users who said it was emblematic of China’s rising power in Pacific countries. Some even said it showed China was an “imperialist state intent on colonizing the world.”US Defense Attaché in the Pacific Islands Constantine Panayiotou and Australian MP Dave Sharma were among those who said they were surprised by the picture, which showed the ambassador walking across the backs of about 30 men lying on the ground. But these narratives were refuted both by local people and by Kiribati's Minister for Environment Ruateki Tekaiara, who was present for the visit of Chinese Ambassador Tang Songgen.Tekaiara, who is also a local MP for Marakei Island, said the ritual was a way to show the highest respect for a visitor. "This is the culture of the island … no-one can oppose this when the elders decide," he said, noting that elders from the island had gathered to organize the welcome, ABC news reported.The Chinese embassy in Kiribati posted a statement on Facebook on Monday saying that Ambassador Tang was due to visit Tabiteuea North, Tabiteuea South and Marakei following an invitation from the island councils and MPs earlier this month.

If he had refused, the ambassador would have insulted the locals. Accepting means ending up with pictures like this,” said El Zorro, a Twitter user, adding that “[I am] not a fan of China at all, but I wouldn’t know what the best approach would be in this situation.”The Chinese Ambassador is not the only one to accept such a traditional welcome. Pictures posted online showed that the princess of Tonga was also welcomed in this way on a previous visit.  The move of stepping on other people’s backs is also a typical element in traditional Samoan dance. Portraying the welcome ceremony as being symbolic of “subjugation” reflects some Western politicians’ grievances and concerns over the growing friendship between China and Kiribati, especially after Kiribati resumed diplomatic relations with China on September 28, 2019, observers said.The previous break in bilateral ties between China and Kiribati was the result of the combined intervention of the US, Australia and other Western countries in Kiribati’s internal elections, Yu Lei, a chief research fellow at the Research Center for Pacific Island Countries at Liaocheng University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Australia has long regarded the South Pacific islands as their "backyard," and a warm welcome to the Chinese Ambassador is clearly not something they wish for, because the island countries are seldom so friendly toward former colonial masters from the West, Yu suggested.
