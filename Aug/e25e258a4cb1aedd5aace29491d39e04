Justin Trudeau Photo: ICCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Chrystia Freeland to be Canada's first female finance minister on Tuesday as an ethics scandal that clipped her predecessor's wings reverberates throughout the government.Freeland received a standing ovation after being sworn in at a small ceremony in Ottawa. Guests socially distanced, wore face masks and Freeland greeted Trudeau with an elbow bump after taking the oath of office, telling reporters that it was "about time that we broke that glass ceiling."The prime minister later announced the suspension of parliament until September 23, when his minority government will lay out a new direction and test its support as confronts the impact of the coronavirus pandemic."We do not want an election," Trudeau said in a statement. "But it's obvious that the Throne Speech we gave eight months ago [outlining the government's agenda] is no longer relevant for the reality that Canadians are living and that our government is facing.""We need to reset the approach of this government to build back better," he said, "and we need to present that to Parliament and gain the confidence of Parliament to move forward on this ambitious plan." Freeland, 52, has held key posts in the Liberal government including deputy prime minister - a role she keeps - and foreign minister, as well as leading free trade talks with the US and Mexico.AFP
