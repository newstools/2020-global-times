These will operate six days a week with half (of their staff) working from home," Lopez said.Churches will hold services outdoors or limit them to individuals or small groups.Restaurants will be able to serve outdoor tables as they begin the process of adapting interiors to the new spacing guidelines.The city's mass transit system, meanwhile, will increase passenger capacity from the current cap of 35 percent to 50 percent.However, an existing program to restrict mobility will remain in force, limiting entry to establishments according to the last digit of residents' identity documents. Likewise, nightclubs and alcohol sales in bars and restaurants are still off limits."Commerce is a blessing because it employs many people, but it is an epidemiological nightmare because it means more people, interaction, customers and cash," Lopez said.The mayor urged residents to remain vigilant despite the easing of restrictions, noting the virus is still active Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
