Mexican security forces on Sunday captured Jose Antonio Yepez, a notorious drug gang leader and fuel thief blamed for fanning a sharp surge in violence that has severely tested the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Flanked by several soldiers, Yepez gave his full name and age before also identifying himself as "Marro."Security forces had been gradually closing in on Yepez but he had managed to evade capture thanks to a tight network of informers who allowed him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, according to analysts and media reports.A thorn in the government's side for several years, El Marro has appeared in expletive-laden videos threatening his enemies, and in June a clip of an emotional Yepez lamenting the arrest of his mother and sister was widely broadcast.The women, who are suspected of helping to run the gang, were released when judges picked apart the case against them.Notorious for fuel theft in a state that is crisscrossed by pipelines and home to a major oil refinery, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel has become increasingly engulfed in a brutal turf war with the CJNG, based in the neighboring state of Jalisco.Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of fuel were being stolen every year before Lopez Obrador cracked down soon after taking office.The lucrative activity gave the Santa Rosa de Lima outfit outsize financial heft, said security analyst Benitez.Newspaper headline: High-profile narco arrested by security
