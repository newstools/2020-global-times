From January to July, CPI rose 3.7 percent from the same period last year.In July, China's PPI fell 2.4 percent year-on-year and rose 0.4 percent month-on-month, according to NBS data."Industrial production continued to pick up, together with market demand, and international commodity prices continued to rise," said Dong.According to the survey of 40 major industrial sectors, prices rose in 21 sectors, went down in fifteen sectors, and remained flat in four sectors, according to NBS.Affected by the continued rebound in international crude oil prices, prices of oil-related industries continued to rise, including oil and natural gas extraction prices, which rose 12.0 percent; and oil, coal and other fuel processing prices which rose 3.4 percent on a monthly basis.From January to July, PPI fell 2.0 percent from last year, while purchasing prices for industrial producers fell 2.7 percent, according the NBS figures.
