(Xinhua/Pavel Bednyakov)A Russian Su-27 fighter jet intercepted two US reconnaissance planes over the Black Sea on Friday, the Russian Defense Ministry has said. "On Aug. 7, Russian airspace control systems detected two air targets approaching the Russian state border over the neutral waters of the Black Sea," the ministry's Zvezda broadcasting service said. A Su-27 fighter took off and its crew at a safe distance identified the targets as a US Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft and a US Navy P-8A reconnaissance plane, it said. After the US planes flew away from the Russian state border, the Russian jet returned to its airfield, Zvezda said.
