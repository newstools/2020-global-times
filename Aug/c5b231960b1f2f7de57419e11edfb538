It cut the reserve requirement ratio and provided 1.8 trillion yuan ($257.7 billion) worth of liquidity via relending schemes, restructured multiple local banks and took over financial institutions with potential risks. The central bank said it will further promote pre-establishment national treatment and a negative list approach, which means foreign companies can invest in sectors outside the list, to further open up the financial sector, promote the yuan's internationalization and safeguard multilateralism. The central bank also said it will support local governments in defusing regional financial risks and it will support small- and medium-sized banks to boost their capital level via bond schemes.Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
