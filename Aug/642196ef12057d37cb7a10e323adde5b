The candidates are relatively young and are selected from all walks of life, including private enterprises, state-owned enterprises, scientific research institutes, and universities, the Organization Department's statement said."The selection of government employees in Hangzhou emphasized young age, crossover talents, and abilities. This method is a breakthrough from the existing methods and is worthy of recognition," Zhang said."Selecting government employees outside the system offers additional channel for talents reserve. Inviting talents from all areas and not limiting to certain recruitment patterns will attract elites in more fields and better serve China's modernization," he added. Hangzhou has been avantgarde in selecting civil servants and government employees through crossover channels.Last year, Xiaoshan district issued an announcement recruiting 11 high-level government employees from the general public. The annual salary plus year-end performance bonus can reach up to one million yuan ($145,000), according to a report by Shanghai Observer on Thursday.Yuhang district in Hangzhou also rolled out similar policy to widen the talent pool in its search for new employees. Among its eight new recruits, Li Wei, the senior director of the advanced micro-nano processing and testing platform of West Lake University has been appointed as deputy director-level leadership position of the district.Zhang added that cautious is needed before the new appointment method  becomes routine."For government employees selected outside the system, a Party-led management system must be adhered to. After their appointments, more rigorous daily inspections and systematic political and ideological training are needed."
