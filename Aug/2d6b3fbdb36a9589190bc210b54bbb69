File photo: HuaweiA spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy in Romania on Sunday accused the US of blatant bullying and political manipulation in its intervention in other countries' establishment of 5G networks by pushing its allies to exclude Huawei. The statement came in response to some Romanian officials' calls to prevent the entry of suspicious firms into its 5G market.As an innovation of and for the international community, every country should accelerate its 5G technological development and application in order to share in its benefits, the embassy said in a statement posted on its website."Unfortunately, certain American politicians have taken advantage of their power to unscrupulously crack down on Huawei in a bid to impede China from getting ahead in the 5G sector," the spokesperson said.The US side has been declaring Huawei 5G equipment unsafe for two years now without evidence. In the meantime, the US' PRISM surveillance program and a number of backdoor incidents have been exposed.The spokesperson said that China's position on the 5G problem has remained unchanged: "China is willing to work with every country to promote international scientific and technological exchange and cooperation based on the market economy and free competition principles. In this way we can provide new momentum for global economic recovery and people's beautiful lives with safe, reliable and good quality information technology."The spokesperson said that every country should objectively review 5G safety risks and discuss 5G network security standards under a representative and authoritative international mechanism and framework, so as to build an evaluation system that strengthens upstream and downstream cooperation to lift 5G security confidence."We hope every country can stick to market economy and free competition principles in order to jointly maintain a good ecosystem for 5G development," the spokesperson added.The spokesperson said that he hopes Romania can clearly recognize the US' underlying political intentions and independently and fairly formulate its 5G policy so that a non-discriminate business climate can be maintained, Chinese enterprises' legitimate rights and interests can be protected, and the big picture of China- Romania economic and trade cooperation can be maintained."We firmly oppose any action that excludes certain companies in the 5G sector that aren't based on technological standards and firmly oppose policies and regulations that violate market principles and international trade rules," the spokesperson stressed.
