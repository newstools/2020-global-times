Zhao Lijian Photo: VCGThe imposition of illegal sanctions on two dozen Chinese firms over false accusations of China militarizing the South China Sea reflects the hegemonic logic and power politics of the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at Thursday's media briefing.China has been minding its own business within its own sovereignty in the South China Sea, which has nothing to do with "militarization" of the area, Zhao said, in response to the US commerce department's announcement on Wednesday that it was adding 24 Chinese firms to the Entity List for helping to build military islands in the South China Sea. Washington claims the firms are helping the Chinese government reclaim and militarize disputed outposts in the South China Sea. The latest Entity List will restrict exports or re-exports of US goods to the named Chinese firms."It is completely legitimate and reasonable to carry out infrastructure construction on our own land," Zhao noted, explaining that the US sanctions are based on its own hegemonic logic and power politics of rudely interfering in other countries' internal affairs. China will take necessary countermeasures to ensure the lawful rights of Chinese enterprises overseas, Zhao said, calling on the US to mind its own business and stop interfering in others' affairs. Global Times
