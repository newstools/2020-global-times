Microsoft also refused to comment.  TikTok is also facing intensifying scrutiny in Canberra, with intelligence agencies putting the app under the microscope and some MPs pressing the Federal Government to ban it, ABC news reported. Triggering protests The pending ban is fueling opposition and sadness among many users, who used methods from live streaming to posting videos in tribute to what they feared was the end of the app that they grew to love. Some TikTok celebrities also asked followers to continue to support them on other social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, according to media reports. Users of the app gave a 4.7 out of 5 rating for TikTok on the app's review page, and protested the US government's upcoming decision to ban it. One TikTok user wrote that Tiktok is like a family. "I will always cherish Tiktok for being something that's like the most supportive bestie you've never had. It can really touch your heart and I will be almost at the point of crying when it's taken down," the user wrote. Clayton Boylan, an American student at George Washington University, also noted that the app is very popular in the US which even enjoys some advantages over the products of the US tech juggernaut. "I think it's hugely popular in America. I mean, even when I'm talking with friends over Facebook, they still send me videos made on TikTok," Boylan told the Global Times on Sunday."My general impression is that it's an app designed to keep people entertained and in touch with each other. People voice all sorts of opinions on there and it helps people from different countries and cultural backgrounds interact, which is positive," Boylan said.Wang Peng, an assistant professor at the Renmin University of China, said that TikTok's popularity among US users, particularly the younger generation, is causing alarm among US politicians about potential challenges it might pose to American tech giants. "The US government wants to maintain the dominance of local tech companies, particularly on the content side, as they look at the popularity of TikTok as a sort of Chinese blow to the US information and technology industries," Wang told the Global Times. According to statistics released by the US website statista.com, TikTok had approximately 37.2 million users in the US in 2019, making it one of the fastest-growing social media apps in the country. About 30 percent of TikTok's active users are teenagers. The website also estimated that TikTok's users could burgeon to 45.4 million by the end of 2020. According to media reports, some American users of TikTok began searching for a solution to circumvent the ban, even by using a Virtual Private Network. Hurting the US economy

In June, TikTok users trolled Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa by pre-booking tickets and not showing up. According to a Time report, thousands of TikTok users recently flooded Trump's 2020 campaign app with negative reviews.  But experts noted that the US government's ban on TikTok would actually hurt the interests of the US economy and local people by not only taking away a key social and entertainment hub from them but cutting a source of income for many of them.In a video that was pushed to all TikTok users in the US, Vanessa Pappas, general director of TikTok US, said that the company has about 1,500 US staff, and that it will offer another ten thousand jobs in the US over the next few years."What the Trump government does may cause many people in the US to lose their jobs or 'flexible income'. It will further hurt the US economy at a time when it's already vulnerable," Wang said. More cautious investmentExperts also suggested that Chinese companies should be more cautious when making future overseas investment plans. "They should take into consideration the potential and long-term political frictions between China and the country they eye to invest in. Also looking for local partners is a better option than investing alone," Wang said. Tang said that if TikTok opts out of the US market, it would hurt the company's valuations, but ByteDance should have contingency plans for such risks and the adverse global environment won't stop its business boom in the Chinese market.
