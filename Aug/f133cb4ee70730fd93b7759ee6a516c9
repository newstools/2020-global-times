SMIC Photo: XinhuaChina's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) said it will "abide by local laws on business and operate accordingly," in response to an investor inquiry about the company's ability to produce high end chipsets for Huawei, after the US banned any company that uses US equipment from supplying Huawei.According to sns.sseinfo.com, a public forum for investors and companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, several investors have asked the company about its ability to make the HiSilicon chipsets based on 14nm technology. Despite repeated inquiries from investors, this is the first time that SMIC has directly responded to the question.There have been high hopes that SMIC could replace Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), after TSMC was restricted by the US from supplying Huawei under a ban that was expanded to cover all companies that use US equipment. The US ban, which was introduced on May 15, said that all suppliers using US equipment have to attain a license before providing anything for Huawei. According to media reports, TSMC will have to finish all existing orders by September 14. The company is reported to have already stopped taking new orders from Huawei. In a previous response, SMIC said it has reached mass production of the 14nm chipsets. SMIC was recently listed in Shanghai after its Hong Kong listing. It witnessed a staggering 246 percent jump in its share price earlier in July, following its debut on Shanghai's Sci-Tech innovation board.Global Times
