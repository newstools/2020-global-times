Rescuers in India pulled a four-year-old boy from the rubble of a collapsed building to loud cheers on Tuesday, hours after the five-story apartment block came down "like a house of cards," killing 13 and burying up to 60 others.The accident late Monday in the western town of Mahad prompted a police probe and led three disaster-response teams and sniffer dogs to work through the night, combing tin sheets, twisted metal and broken bricks.Officials said many residents of the 47 flats inside the building were spared because they had already fled the town to escape the coronavirus pandemic.AFP
