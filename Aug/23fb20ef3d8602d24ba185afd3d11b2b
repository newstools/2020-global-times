A security officer at the Shenzhen metro in South China's Guangdong Province has been given five days of administrative detention after he was caught to have secretly touched and sniffed a female passenger's hair, police said on Sunday.  The security officer, surnamed Wu, 19 years old, confessed that he committed the misconduct in a compartment of metro line 3 in Shenzhen on Wednesday after a video showing the hair-sniffer wearing a security uniform went viral and drew widespread attention from netizens, according to the notice published on the official Weibo account of Shenzhen police. The punishment came after Shenzhen metro said in a notice on Saturday that it found out that the security officer committed the misbehavior on metro line 3 on Wednesday morning while he was on duty.  Wu had been suspended from his post and put under police investigation, the notice said. Many female viewers were disturbed by the misbehavior shown in the video, while some netizens accused the man of sexually harassing the woman in public. "It is ironic that a man whose job is to protect those onboard would conduct such disgraceful acts against female passengers," one comment reads. Global Times
