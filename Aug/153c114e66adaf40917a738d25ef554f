But I want to be clear: There are green shoots of hope," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said."It's never too late to turn the outbreak around," he said.He gave examples of countries that had successfully clamped down on COVID-19, such as Rwanda and New Zealand, which said Monday it plans to open a virus-free "travel bubble" with the Cook Islands.With much of the world caught in a cycle of dispiriting outbreaks and economically crushing lockdowns, all eyes are on the race for a vaccine.A WHO overview said 165 candidate vaccines are being worked on worldwide, with six reaching Phase 3 of clinical evaluation.But the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan warned that a vaccine was "only part of the answer," pointing to polio and measles as diseases with vaccines that have not been fully eradicated."You've got to be able to deliver that vaccine to a population that want and demand to have that vaccine," he said.Infections have been rising ominously in Western Europe, which has also been sweltering through a heat wave, with temperatures soaring above 35 C.The blistering heat sent crowds flocking to beaches at the weekend despite health warnings about the risk of infection.In the Paris region, people aged 11 and over are now required to wear masks in crowded areas and tourist hot spots. These include the banks of the Seine River and more than 100 streets in the French capital.Several French towns and cities have already introduced similar measures, as well as parts of Belgium, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain.AFP
