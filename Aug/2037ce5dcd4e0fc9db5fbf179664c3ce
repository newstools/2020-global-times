A share of the cattle supplied to Brazil's markets are fattened on illegally deforested Amazon land. To conceal that fact from buyers, the animals often are passed through many hands and holdings before being sold, Brazilian researchers said.

But it and other agreements "are not being used effectively to promote international cooperation for the region," Abdenur said.According to MapBiomas, an organization that investigates and validates deforestation alerts in Brazil, more than 90 percent of all forest loss in the Amazon basin is illegal. And the situation is worsening, the group said, with deforestation in Brazil rising more than 34 percent in the 12 months through July, compared to 2019.Newspaper headline: 90% of deforestation illegal: study
