About 56,000 computer servers outside the Chinese mainland controlled malicious programs that infected about 5.52 million computer hosts in China. The US, Japan and Hong Kong were the countries and regions in which most servers were located, with the US accounting for 31.4 percent of servers. Servers located in the US, the Netherlands and France controlled the highest number of computers in China. US servers controlled 4.29 million Chinese computers in the year, accounting for 77.7 percent of the total.As the international situation becomes more complex, the number of organized and politically motivated cyber attacks continues to rise. In recent years, APT attacks launched against China have been continuously exposed, with the scale and intensity of attacks increasing year by year, and targets including important departments and industries related to the national economy and people's livelihoods, according to CNCERT.By the end of 2020, China will have gradually established an institutionalized, systematic and standardized data security management mechanism to speed up the implementation of data security compliance requirements.New challenges have emerged with new technologies. 5G, IPv6 and blockchain technology have supported traditional industries and given rise to the development of smart industries. But it is urgent to study new risks and threats to the network, new types of attacks and defensive countermeasures.
