China's path to greatness has indeed been difficult, and the diplomats on the frontline have worked very hard. Stay Strong, China!" one said."All returned, stationed, fearless Chinese diplomats deserve respect! Thank you for being at the forefront of the conflict, making China's position clear, expressing China's attitude and telling China's story to the world well," another one wrote.The US abruptly asked China to close its consulate in Houston within 72 hours in July. This was a unilateral political provocation by the US against China, a grave violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations, a grave violation of relevant provisions of the China-US consular treaty, and a deliberate attempt to undermine China-US relations, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on July 22.China ordered the US to shut its consulate in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province on July 24 in retaliation."Some in the US have been seeking to sabotage China-US relations, and are deliberately disrupting China's development. But we believe dialogue rather than confrontation is what the two peoples want. China's future will be determined by the Chinese people, not anyone else," Hua Chunying, another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said on Twitter on Monday.
