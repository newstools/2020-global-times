The country's military budget exceeded $716 billion in 2019, equivalent to the combined total for the military budgets of the nine countries after it. Zhao also threw three questions at Esper: Can the US make the same proclamation as China in sticking to peaceful development and opposing hegemonism? Which one is it that owns hundreds of military bases all over the world, and illegally launched a war against Iraq, Libya and Syria, and sends aircraft far away from its soil to flex its muscles?And the last question: who is clinging to the Cold War mentality and keeps tearing up agreements, withdrawing from organizations and breaking global rules?"If US politicians respect the facts, they will come up with the right answer," said Zhao. Global Times
