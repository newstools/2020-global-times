Both the suspect and the officer were taken to hospital."The Secret Service Office of Professional Responsibility will be conducting an internal review of the officer's actions," Sullivan said, adding the DC Metropolitan Police Department had been contacted.As the president was speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room, a Secret Service bodyguard abruptly approached him and interrupted, saying in a quiet voice, "Sir, could you please come with me?"Trump and staff members left. Doors to the briefing room, still filled with journalists, were locked.Outside, black-clad Secret Service agents with automatic rifles could be seen rushing across the lawn and took up positions behind trees. According to Fox News, whose camera team was outside, two shots were heard.Minutes later, Trump reappeared at the press conference and announced that someone had been shot by the Secret Service outside the White House grounds.AFP
