Qian reminded that the employment of people in the wild animal breeding trade needs to be addressed as well.The relevant authorities are trying different measures to stop wild animal breeding while also ensuring farmer's incomes remain sustainable; for example, creating new job opportunities, providing skill training, exploring new business opportunities alongside economic compensation."Our county's wild animal breeding mainly focuses on snakes," Qiu Guoqiang, head of the Deqing Wetland and Wildlife Protection Administration in East China's Zhejiang Province, told the Global Times. "We will use snakes purely for medicinal purposes, which is allowed to continue in accordance with regulations." Previously, the snake farming sector in Deqing also involved in food industry.The species affected by the campaign include six categories like snakes, ducks, pheasants, bamboo rats, porcupines, and civet cats, with more than 240,000 relevant employees involved, based on a report made by Shen Yueyue, vice chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, on August 10.The evaluation of the animals involved exceeded 11 billion yuan ($1.6 billion), and the facility investment is about 7.4 billion yuan, Shen said.
