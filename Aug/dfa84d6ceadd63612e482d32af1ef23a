Continuously pushing out an election does not lessen the risk of disruption," the prime minster said, adding she would not change the election date again.This decision gives all parties time over the next nine weeks to campaign and the Electoral Commission enough time to ensure an election can go ahead, Ardern said.Advance voting begins on Oct. 3, she added.
