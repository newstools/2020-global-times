Photo:cnsphotoChina's national Consumer Confidence Index led major economies in August by rebounding to 72.9 points, becoming the only economy to show a gain from January, France-based market research firm Ipsos reported Monday.Compared with January, every country's national index was down except for China's, which posted an increase of 3.2 points in August, the report showed. By contrast, six countries — including the US, India and Brazil — saw their indices decline by more than 10 points.The swift rebound of Chinese consumer confidence was in part due to China's success in quickly getting the coronavirus outbreak under control, Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times Tuesday.China developed a very effective epidemic management system, which was backed by advanced technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence, Tian said. "Domestic consumers are not as pessimistic as they were during the early stage of the outbreak, as they can now pursue normal business and social activities with the help of new tools like health QR codes and digital thermometers," he said.

It's based on a monthly survey of more than 17,500 adults under the age of 75 conducted on Ipsos' Global Advisor online platform.
