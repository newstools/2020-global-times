Microsoft is believed to be the buyer.Lee, who is familiar with Google's affairs in China, wrote that China has laid out clear and specific rules and regulations for foreign internet firms. He said Google entered the Chinese market and later chose to leave, with full understanding of these rules. In contrast, the US government did not initially make clear what was required of TikTok to sustain its US business, nor did it substantiate its later accusations, Lee said, indicating a comparison between the China's handling of Google and the US' handling of TikTok could not stand.Lee's comments, posted in a group chat named "500 old pals from the internet circle," were liked by several group members and resonated with some Chinese analysts. Fang Xingdong, founder of Beijing-based technology think tank ChinaLabs and a member of the chat group, said Lee's comments were a restoration of truth and the facts at a time when many have surrendered good judgment to sentiment."Until today, many people's memories of how Google left the Chinese market have been distorted, and that is a misunderstanding that needs to be addressed," Fang told the Global Times on Tuesday.Google's exit from the Chinese mainland and the US' handling of TikTok are both conflicts between corporations and governments, but they are by nature two utterly different matters, Fang said.Google elected to shut down its search engine service in the Chinese mainland market in 2010.
