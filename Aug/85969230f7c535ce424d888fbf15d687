It is the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China, Science and Technology Daily reported. The TBM uses several self-developed technologiessuch as an automatic mud water circulation system. The underwater tunnel, once completed, will reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes. As an important project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Karnaphuli River bottom tunnel project is expected to boost local tourism and industrial development, and increase employment and export opportunities, the report noted. The Padma Bridge, another BRI project in Bangladesh, is now under construction.
