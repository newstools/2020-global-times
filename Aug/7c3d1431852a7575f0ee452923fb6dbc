An international team of marine scientists have discovered 30 new species of invertebrates in deep water surrounding the Galapagos, the Ecuadoran archipelago's national park authorities announced on Monday.

The area is home to the world's largest shark population."These pristine seamounts are within the Galapagos Marine Reserve and are protected from destructive human practices such as fishing with bottom trawls or deep-sea mining that are known to have catastrophic impacts upon fragile communities. Now it is our responsibility to make sure they remain pristine for the generations to come," Salinas de Leon said."The many discoveries made on this expedition showcase the importance of deep-sea exploration to developing an understanding of our oceans," said Nicole Raineault, chief scientist of the Ocean Exploration Trust.The Galapagos archipelago is a fragile ecosystem that harbors the largest number of animal species on the planet.
