Brazil's commitment is to reduce deforestation to zero by 2030," under the Paris climate agreement, he added."But you don't reach that goal overnight. It takes a consistent, coherent plan."Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set a new record for the first six months of 2020, with 3,069 square kilometers cleared, according to satellite data - an area bigger than Luxembourg, and an increase of 25 percent over 2019.That has revived international pressure on Brazil to do more to protect the forest, a vital resource in the fight to curb climate change.Exacerbating the situation, the Pantanal, the world's largest wetlands - a region situated just south of the Amazon and stretching from Brazil into Paraguay and Bolivia - had a record 1,684 fires in July, triple the number in July 2019.Salles faced intense criticism in April when a video recording was made public of a Bolsonaro cabinet meeting at which he said the coronavirus pandemic was an opportunity to roll back regulations "now that the media's only talking about COVID[-19]."He denied that he meant weakening environmental regulations, saying that he simply opposed red tape in general.The Bolsonaro administration has been at pains recently to show a more aggressive stance on deforestation, particularly after international investment funds controlling $4 trillion in capital threatened to pull out of the country over the issue. AFP
