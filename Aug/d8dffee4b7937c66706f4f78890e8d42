A Mexican judge has sentenced the man convicted of ordering the 2017 murder of prominent journalist Miroslava Breach to 50 years imprisonment, a singular judgment in one of the deadliest countries globally for media.

More than 100 have been killed since 2000, but 90 percent of the murders remain unresolved.Prosecutors said in a statement that the 50-year sentence set a precedent in cases involving crimes against free expression, adding it was the longest sentence to date for such crimes.Propuesta Civica, a nongovernmental organization that advocates for human rights and free expression, said Moreno's sentence "represents an important precedent in the fight against impunity for crimes against journalists in this, the most violent country for the press." But the organization called for further investigations of others involved in Breach's murder, as well as an inquiry into the "possible involvement of officials of the current government of Chihuahua."Breach, a 54-year-old veteran crime and politics reporter for the newspapers La Jornada and Norte de Juarez, was found dead inside her car with gunshot wounds to the head on March 23, 2017 in Chihuahua state.Newspaper headline: Mexican reporter’s killer jailed for 50 years in rare judgment
