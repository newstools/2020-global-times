Instead, it's a storm center. There's only chaos," Clinton said."Just one thing never changes - his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame," Clinton said.The president faced a barrage of criticism on opening night too, most notably from former first lady Michelle Obama saying Trump lacks the character and skills for the job."I thought it was a very divisive speech, extremely divisive," Trump told reporters.In her pretaped remarks to the convention, Obama urged Americans to rally behind Biden, her husband's former vice president, in the November 3 presidential election.Trump's White House is marred by "chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy," Barack Obama's wife said in unprecedented criticism of a sitting US president by a former first lady."Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country," she added. "He is clearly in over his head."AFP
