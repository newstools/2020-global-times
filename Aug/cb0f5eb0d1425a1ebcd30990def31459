The report linked the reasons for the shortage to the US reliance on outsourcing PPE manufacturing to China and concerns about so-called fraud.There has been a lack of understanding of Chinese standards in destination markets, analysts said."The Chinese quality requirements for masks are no lower than those of the FDA or CE, but those who receive these foreign markings don't necessarily meet domestic standards," Bai Yu, president of the Medical Appliances Branch of the China Medical Pharmaceutical Material Association, told the Global Times.Bai predicted that more than 95 percent of China's mask producers will go bankrupt, mainly because they do not have the FDA or CE markings that would allow them to export. These companies' production capacity is sufficient to supply the whole world.Despite the hurdles, China has been a major provider of PPE to the US.As of August 2, China had provided 26.5 billion masks, 330 million protective gowns, 31 million pairs of protective goggles, 610 million pairs of surgical gloves and 11,500 ventilators to the US, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on August 7.China is willing to ensure that economic and trade matters go smoothly in an effort to guard global free trade, Hong Shibin, an expert in manufacturing production supply chains, told the Global Times on Sunday.However, the Trump administration's antagonistic moves targeting China have gone beyond what a company can manage, and supply shortages may persist if the US government doesn't make a change, Hong noted.
