LMC is a new sub-regional cooperation mechanism of wide consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits among the six countries," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at Friday's regular press conference. "Over the past four years since its launch, the mechanism has developed rapidly, improved its rules, expanded its areas of cooperation and strengthened its impetus for development, bringing tangible benefits to the people of the six countries."Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the six countries have extended assistance to each other, effectively contained the spread of COVID-19, made positive contributions to the fight against virus in East Asia and the world at large, and contributed to the resumption of work and production of regional economic recovery, Zhao stressed.The third LMC leaders' meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Vientiane, Laos, earlier this year, but was postponed due to the outbreak. All parties agreed that it is necessary to hold the meeting as soon as possible in a flexible manner and timely provide strategic guidance for the LMC in light of the new situation, the spokesperson said.
