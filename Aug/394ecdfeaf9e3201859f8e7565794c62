File photo Hong KongChina cannot accept France's wrong remarks on Hong Kong, and urges France to stop using the national security law for Hong Kong to interfere in China's internal affairs, the Chinese embassy in France said. France has the right to decide whether or not to ratify foreign agreements. However, the French side has linked the decision to China's national security law for Hong Kong and made erroneous remarks on Hong Kong-related issues, which is unacceptable to China, a spokesperson of the embassy said on Wednesday. The spokesperson's remarks came after France decided to halt the 2017 extradition treaty with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), a decision that the French foreign ministry said was made in the wake of China's national security law for the HKSAR, which they believe violates "one country, two systems" and "fundamental freedoms" and affects French people and firms. The embassy spokesperson said that after the implementation of the law, the HKSAR will continue to enjoy a high degree of autonomy, all rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents will be unaffected, and the rights and interests of foreign nationals and enterprises in Hong Kong will continue to be fully protected.It is the anti-Chinese rioters and the overseas anti-China forces behind them that have undermined "one country, two systems," the spokesperson said.They took advantage of the loopholes in Hong Kong's laws to engage in activities splitting the country and subverting state power in Hong Kong in order to turn the relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland into "one country, one system" - both into capitalist systems, the spokesperson said.Global Times
