Many have joined hands with livestreaming platforms to offer online sales of their products to the public.So far, more than 60 museums and cultural and creative stores, both at home and abroad, have opened online shops on Tmall with more than 700 million collective visits, said Liu Qian, who is in charge of the cultural and creative business on Tmall."Dunhuang culture is a treasure for the world, and 200 million users of Tmall are from Generation Z, so we hope to create more opportunities for young people to know about Dunhuang," she said.The Mogao Grottoes are home to collections of Buddhist artworks - more than 2,000 colored sculptures and 45,000 square meters of murals - in 735 caves carved along a cliff by ancient worshippers.They were first constructed in 366. For more than 1,000 years, the site was a popular stop for travelers and a religious shrine on the ancient Silk Road.Â
