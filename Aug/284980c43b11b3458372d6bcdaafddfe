Flower Sea at the 2020 Beijing International Light Festival Photo: Courtesy of Beijing GehuaA new immersive art festival featuring 15 light installations will light up the night in Beijing when it kicks off on Thursday at Yuyuantan Park. Making full use of the park's trees and flowers, the Alive Together: Beijing International Light Festival incorporates narrative light installations to present various vistas ranging from oceans and forests to outer space. Each of these 15 installations stand out individually, but can also be seen as a single work that mixes arts and high technology.   For instance, the latest technology has been used to create the special section Rain of Sakura, which transports visitors to a scene in which cherry blossom petals float through the air like flakes of snow.  In the music section, Chinese traditional music and modern techno and electronic music are all used to establish different moods. The festival, only available at night, is set to run until December.
