The cut to the department's $409 million annual budget fell way short of the 50 percent demanded by protesters following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in police custody on May 25.Council President Lorena Gonz√°lez called the move a "down-payment for future potential reductions" to the budget of the Seattle Police Department.Defunding advocates oppose the militarization of US police forces and say officers are called on to deal with issues like addiction, mental illness and homelessness that could be better addressed by social services. Law-enforcement supporters say cuts to police spending will lead to more crime.The council begins 2021 budget talks in September and Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best have signaled their willingness to rethink policing and consider $76 million in proposed cuts to the department's 2021 budget.The revised 2020 budget followed a council inquest into the department that revealed that 56 percent of 911 calls are for noncriminal activity and 3 percent of calls result in arrest.
