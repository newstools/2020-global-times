The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft shoved off from the International Space Station on Saturday with two US astronauts on board, beginning their journey back to Earth despite a storm threatening Florida.

But the most important part is bringing us home."Addressing his son and Hurley's son, he held up a toy dinosaur that the children chose to send on the mission and said: "Tremor The Apatosaurus is headed home soon and he'll be with your dads."Behnken later tweeted: "All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go."Mission chief Chris Cassidy called it an "exciting day" and hailed the importance of having a new means to transport astronauts.The mission, which blasted off on May 30, marked the first time a crewed spaceship had launched into orbit from US soil since 2011 when the space shuttle program ended.It was also the first time a private company has flown to the ISS carrying astronauts.The US has paid SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing a total of about $7 billion for their "space taxi" contracts. But Boeing's program has floundered badly after a failed test run in late 2019, which left SpaceX, a company founded only in 2002, as clear frontrunner.For the past nine years, US astronauts traveled exclusively on Russian Soyuz rockets, for a price of around $80 million per seat. Behnken and Hurley will have a few hours for sleep during the journey home.Newspaper headline: NASA crews ending mission
