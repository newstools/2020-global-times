A boat with refugees and migrants arrives at Skala Sikaminias, on the Greek island of Lesbos, Greece, Feb. 29, 2020. (Xinhua/Marios Lolos)A British minister on Tuesday pressed France to intensify efforts to halt the "completely unacceptable" numbers of migrants crossing the English Channel in often unseaworthy small boats.Immigration Minister Chris Philp met French officials in Paris as concern grows in London over the numbers of migrants entering British waters from France."French authorities are doing a great deal of work... but the sheer numbers crossing the Channel are completely unacceptable. Unacceptable to the French government and unacceptable to the UK government," Philp told reporters."So it's quite clear that more needs to be done," he said in a statement.He added the countries were working on a comprehensive action plan "with the objective in mind of completely cutting this route."Britain's right-wing Conservative Party government has looked to increase pressure on France to prevent migrants coming into UK waters.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said illegal migrant crossings were "very bad and stupid and dangerous," adding they needed to be stopped in cooperation with France.British Interior Minister Priti Patel and French counterpart Gerald Darmanin signed an agreement in July creating a new joint police intelligence unit to combat migrant traffickers, but it is unclear whether this has had any impact.AFP
