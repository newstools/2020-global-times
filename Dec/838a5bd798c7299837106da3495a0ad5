The pricing mechanism is unreasonable, Luo said.Since 2015, China has relied on imported iron ore for more than 80 percent of its supply. With steel prices up less than 15 percent since the start of the year compared with a big rise in iron ore prices, upstream cost increases are hard to digest.Steel prices in 2017 and 2018 were not the highest in history, but when iron ore cost $70 or $80 per ton, steel mills were profitable, a Chinese steelmaker told the Global Times on condition of anonymity on Wednesday."Now the price has skyrocketed to $150 to $160. The upstream end is devouring the profits of the entire industry chain. How can the downstream survive?" said the steelmaker.Another factor is the pricing mechanism itself, which has allowed prices to seriously deviate from the fundamentals of supply and demand, industry insiders said, noting that iron ore spot trading is based on index pricing.China remains the world's largest importer of iron ore, with a total of 1.06 billion tons imported in 2019. Of this, about 70 percent was from Australia and about 20 percent from Brazil, according to China customs.However, Brazil's ability to export iron ore has declined since the Tamsui Valley tailings dam collapsed in January last year, and Simandou, in Guinea, has yet to produce iron ore, so the Pilbara region of Western Australia has become the main source of iron ore destined for China, media reports said.Newspaper headline: Industry insiders urge fair reporting
