"It could be a significantly improved pulse-Doppler radar or a passive electronically scanned array (PESA) radar. The possibility for an AESA radar should also not be fully ruled out."An upgraded radar system can potentially boost the aircraft's situational awareness on the battlefield by detecting targets further away, track more targets simultaneously and enable the use of missiles from longer ranges, military observers said.The PLA Air Force operates a large number of J-11Bs, and if the existing ones can also be upgraded, it will significantly boost the Air Force's overall combat capability, analysts said.
