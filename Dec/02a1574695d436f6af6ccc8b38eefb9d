Jiuzhang is also 10 billion times faster than its Google counterpart, named Sycamore, in certain calculations.The establishment of Jiuzhang marks China's quantum advantage (also known as "quantum supremacy"), a term used to describe quantum computers' far stronger computing ability compared to classical supercomputers.
