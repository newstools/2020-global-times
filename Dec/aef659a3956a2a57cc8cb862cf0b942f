Tourists staying longer than 28 days are free to book any type of accommodation registered with the SLTDA, Fernando said.Long-stay travellers, dual passport holders or Sri Lankan passport holders travelling with international tourists in a group, resident permit holders, film tourism and sports tourism visa types will be considered according to the guidelines.Fernando also said the SLTDA has proposed to issue visas for six months instead of the current one month and is awaiting cabinet approval while noting that the issuance of visas on-arrival are suspended until further notice.Sri Lanka's international airports have been closed since March, following the detection of the first local COVID-19 patient and have been open only for repatriations.The island country has since then detected over 23,000 cases and is presently facing its second wave with the Western Province which includes capital Colombo being the worst affected.
