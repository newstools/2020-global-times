I'm not aware of it," Hua said when asked about the social media paocai-kimchi clash. She emphasized that cooperation and shared benefits between China and South Korea surely overweigh that.Many Chinese netizens were also puzzled by the “bitterness” of South Korean netizens, saying kimchi and paocai are two different types of food.
