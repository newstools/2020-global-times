We had patience, endurance, (and) resistance," he said.The National Assembly was declared in contempt by the Supreme Court of Justice almost five years ago, and the newly elected 277 deputies will take office in the coming months."Today's vote is a vote of rebellion, of independence, to tell the world that Venezuela is nobody's colony, that Venezuela is a free, sovereign and independent country," he said.More than 20 million Venezuelans were eligible to vote in this Sunday's elections to choose legislators from more than 14,400 candidates registered by 107 national and regional political organizations.
