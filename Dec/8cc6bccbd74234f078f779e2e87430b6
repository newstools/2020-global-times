China Australia Illustration: Liu Rui/GT Given the difficult times China and Australia’s bilateral relations have been going through, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday asked Australia to “consider seriously” what China means to it and called for a return to a healthy development track.“Australia should seriously consider a question: Is China a threat or a partner to Australia? If Australia sees China as a threat, how can China-Australia relations improve? If Australia regards China as a partner, we have the basic premise for dialogue and cooperation,” Wang noted during a video meeting with the US Asia Society.Over the past two years, China has heard too many negative voices from Australia and seen various negative actions. This will naturally affect enthusiasm for cooperation and exchanges between the two countries, Wang said.“The current difficulties in China-Australia relations is not what China wants to see. We still hope that China-Australia relations can return to the track of normal and healthy development,” he said.Wang said that China and Australia are both members of the larger Asia-Pacific family. The two countries have maintained long-term close exchanges from all walks of life. The economies of China and Australia are highly complementary, which has brought benefits to both sides. Global Times
