The infections have also extended from cold-chain food to containers, according to the investigation conducted by the Global Times and published on Sunday.Since Chinese customs reported that coronavirus was found on packaging of imported frozen shrimp from Ecuador in July, 16 provincial-level regions have reported at least 41 cold-chain related coronavirus cases, according to publicly available statistics.Since June 11, Beijing has reported 335 confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to a cluster of infections in the Xinfadi wholesale market. As part of the overall enhanced measures in the capital city, the Jingshen Seafood Market, a major seafood wholesale market, located about eight kilometers from Beijing's Xinfadi market, stopped granting access to individual customers after it was reopened in mid-September.Â
