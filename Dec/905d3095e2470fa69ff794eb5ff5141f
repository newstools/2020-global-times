The New Zealand man who murdered British backpacker Grace Millane committed violent sex crimes against two other women, a court revealed Tuesday, as the killer was publicly named for the first time.

But a judgement released Tuesday revealed that he was still awaiting trial on a string of sexual offenses when the Millane verdict came in, and the court feared naming him could prejudice those proceedings.It said the killer had since faced separate trials in October and November, and been found guilty at both. In the first, he was convicted of sexual violation, assault and threatening to kill his former partner. The second resulted in a rape conviction involving another woman that Kempson met on Tinder. Sentencing for those crimes has not yet been delivered.Newspaper headline: NZ backpacker killer named for first time
