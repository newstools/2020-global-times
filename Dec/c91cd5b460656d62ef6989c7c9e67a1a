At least four drugmakers expect their COVID-19 vaccines will be effective against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that is raging in Britain and are performing tests that should provide confirmation in a few weeks.

Boxes containing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are prepared to be shipped at the McKesson distribution center on Sunday in Olive Branch, Mississippi. The US on Saturday (local time) reported more than 400,000 coronavirus infections, creating a world new high for daily cases.

That means that 99 percent of the protein is still the same."The mutation known as the B.1.1.7 lineage may be up to 70 percent more infectious and more of a concern for children.In the event that the variant presents vaccine developers with an unexpected challenge, an advantage of mRNA is that scientists can quickly reengineer genetic material in the shot to match that of the mutated protein, whereas modifying traditional vaccines would require extra steps."In principle, the beauty of the mRNA technology is we can directly start to engineer a vaccine which completely mimics this new mutation," Sahin said."We could be able to provide a new vaccine technically within six weeks. Of course, this is not only a technical question. We have to deal with how regulators... would see that."Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and CureVac all developed mRNA vaccines, while AstraZeneca has a more traditional vaccine that uses an adenovirus found in chimpanzees to deliver genetic material from the coronavirus to spur an immune response.Germany's CureVac started late-stage clinical trials on its vaccine candidate on December 14 and is constantly reviewing variants, which the company said are common as viruses spread.Britain's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said on Saturday vaccines appeared to be adequate in generating an immune response to the variant of the coronavirus.The World Health Organization said on Tuesday it will convene a meeting of members to discuss strategies to counter the mutation.Newspaper headline: More study, data collection needed
