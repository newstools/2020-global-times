More than 100 scientists have urged the European Commission to address urgently a "critical oversight" in its planned rules on sustainable finance that they say could undermine the bloc's climate change goals.

The Commission's proposal omits the requirement for the limit to decrease over time."We assume this omission can only be an unfortunate administrative oversight in these extraordinary times that, however, needs urgent correction," the scientists said.Â The green finance rules should make "absolutely clear that the threshold has to decline" to net zero emissions by 2050, Andreas Hoepner, a professor at University College Dublin, said.He led the initiative to send the letter with Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. Hoepner sits on an expert group that advises the Commission, the EU executive.The Commission is taking feedback on its proposal until December 18, before writing the final rules.Another statement from a group of NGOs, seen by Reuters and due to be released next week, backs the scientists' call for a declining emissions threshold, and asks for bioenergy and livestock farming to face tighter environmental criteria or be denied a green investment label.Newspaper headline: Experts express concerns about emissions
