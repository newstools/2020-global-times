Also, Chinese central bank officials warned against the risk of a "policy cliff" -- a sudden turn of policy direction — in recent days. "Monetary policy is likely to remain relatively loose in 2021, channeling enough funds to the real economy to keep factories running and stabilize employment," Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Tuesday. As sporadic new coronavirus cases have been reported across China, which may prompt Chinese people to take a more cautious attitude toward consumption and travel, it is vital that monetary policy ensures Chinese consumers' spending power in the next year, analysts said. "Looking ahead, Chinese policy-makers will coordinate macro policy in a flexible manner, depending on how the economic situation evolves," Dong said, noting that Beijing could cut banks' reserve requirement ratio in the second half of 2021, if necessary.But analysts noted that some tailored easing policies aimed at tackling the impact of the coronavirus will be phased out.For example, China is not likely to issue special Treasury bonds for combating COVID-19 next year, Dong said. He also predicted that quotas on local governments' special-purpose bonds will be reduced.As part of efforts to prop up its virus-hit economy, China issued 1 trillion yuan in special Treasury bonds for COVID-19 control and economic recovery in 2020.According to a report by the Guotai Junan Securities, China could also lower its fiscal deficit ratio next year to 3-3.5 percent or even lower, from 3.6 percent in 2020.Newspaper headline: Continuation of monetary, fiscal policy expected next year
