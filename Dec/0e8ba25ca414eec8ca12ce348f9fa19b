Aoba has reportedly confessed to the arson, and is said to have shouted "drop dead" before starting the fire.There have been claims that he accused the studio of stealing his work, which Kyoto Animation has denied doing.Many of those killed in the blaze were young, including a 21-year-old woman.Parents of some of the victims told local media in May when Aoba was charged that they were still suffering the devastating loss of their loved ones.The attack sent shock waves through the anime industry and its fans in Japan and around the world."These are people who carry the Japanese animation industry on their shoulders," Kyoto Animation's President Hideaki Hatta told reporters at the time."It's heartbreaking. Japanese jewels were lost."
