This limited the training of pilot cadets, Wang said, noting that since a second aircraft carriers is now available, more pilot cadets can be recruited and receive adequate training.Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie told the Global Times in a previous interview that the PLA Navy not only needs pilots for fighter jets on aircraft carriers, but also helicopter pilots for its Type 075 amphibious assault ships.Analysts said a Type 075 ship could host dozens of helicopters. Media reports said two Type 075s are undergoing sea trials, and a third one is being built.
