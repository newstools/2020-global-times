Such mishaps can result in hard landings, runway overshoots or even crashes.Worried by IATA's data, insurers are questioning airlines about whether they are doing extra pilot training to focus on landings, said Gary Moran, head of Asia aviation at insurance broker Aon PLC."They want to know about the circumstances of the training," he said.Approaches and landings place significant demands on crew for which training and regular experience are seen as vital.
