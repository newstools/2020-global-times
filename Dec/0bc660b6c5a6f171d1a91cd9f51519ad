Hikvision and SMIC were on the removed list.The financial crackdown on Chinese companies indicates an escalation of decoupling between China and the US that emerged from trade tensions, said Raymond Deng, investment strategist CIO of consumer investment and insurance products at DBS Bank.The removal of the companies from global indices would inevitably restrict capital flows into the affected securities, Deng told the Global Times on Thursday. In a statement released on December 4, SMIC said that following its addition to a list of Chinese military entities compiled by the US Defense Department, all US persons won't be allowed to purchase its securities for 60 days beginning December 4. Additionally, after 365 days from that point, all US persons will be banned from dealings in SMIC's securities. Deng noted that even if "The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act" that could block Chinese listings from the US market eventually comes into force, Chinese companies will still have alternative listing venues - either in the Chinese mainland market and Hong Kong, or European and Southeast Asian markets, where Chinese listings are hugely welcome. Newspaper headline: S&P Global index arm drops 21 Chinese firms
