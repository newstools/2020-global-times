As a result, true wireless stereo bluetooth chips are in short supply, Sun Yanbiao, head of Shenzhen-based research firm N1mobile, told the Global Times on Monday. A report from elecfans.com cited Song Shuo, CEO of Chinese bluetooth firm Trlink, as saying that the bluetooth chips made by Qualcomm had been "in short of supply" for a long time. The chip shortage has come at a time when demand for chips is surging in China, with the country's push for 5G development and new-energy cars, and when mobile phone companies are increasing their stockpiling of chips amid political uncertainties."After Huawei's crisis [as a result of US sanctions], many mobile phone companies stockpiled products on a massive scale to ensure the safety of their supply chains. This has caused chip factories' production to be tight and extended the delivery cycles of those factories," Han Xiaomin, general manager of JiWei Insights, told the Global Times.According to Han, major chipmakers like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp are working at "full capacity". However, he said that the tight supply situation has not affected terminal companies' business much yet, though the orders should take longer time to fulfill. "Most terminal industries, including car or mobile phone sectors, are not severely short of chips, as most of them are primarily supplied by large companies whose capacity is stable," Han said. But there's a gap between manufacturing capacity and market demand, he noted. "The market is advancing and there is demand for higher chip production capacity, but not enough manufacturing lines are being built. There are not enough large factories to meet demand, while small factories are at a loss as how to increase capacity," he said. The consumer electronics company manager predicted that the shortage will ease in half a year, when the China-US trade relations might thaw, and the pandemic should be brought under control. Newspaper headline: Chip shortage expands to car, headphone industries
