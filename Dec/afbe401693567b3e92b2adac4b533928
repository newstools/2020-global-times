Britain's Queen Elizabeth II will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine within weeks, after UK regulators granted emergency approval and the world's first roll-out begins this week, reports late Saturday said.

Other elderly people and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be next, with the rest of the population then prioritized by age.The Daily Mirror also reported a string of high-profile figures in Britain had committed publicly to getting the vaccine in a bid to boost take-up.They include Monty Python star Michael Palin and Bob Geldof, the tabloid said.Britain has preordered 40 million doses of the vaccine in total, and is set to receive an initial batch of 800,000 to begin next week's rollout. Regulators were forced to defend their world-first approval on Wednesday of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, insisting it met all safety standards after US and European officials queried the rapid process.Meanwhile, plans are reportedly being stepped up to ensure any complications arising from the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31 do not impact its rollout.The vaccine will be manufactured at Pfizer's plant in Puurs, Belgium, and needs to be transported in temperature-controlled thermal shippers that use dry ice.The Observer reported late Saturday that ministers have drawn up contingency plans to fly millions of doses into Britain on military aircraft.Newspaper headline: UK’s Queen Elizabeth II to get COVID-19 vaccine
