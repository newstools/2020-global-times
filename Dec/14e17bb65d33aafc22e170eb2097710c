It safeguards world peace and opposes acts of invasion and expansion, Xinhua reported.This reflects China's consistent belief that it loves peace and opposes war, the unnamed official said.The new amendment puts stress on embodying the sense of justice of China's national defense, which indicates that China will make itself heard in terms of global justice, particularly in opposing acts of invasion and expansion by regional and global hegemonies, in addition to safeguarding China's own sovereignty, security and development interests, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.With the egoistic hegemonies conspiring and making actions and an increased existence of terrorism, secessionism and nationalism, today's world is not peaceful and needs China to play a unique role in making sound justice, Song said.It has become necessary for China to boost its national defense capabilities, including the capabilities to use them overseas for just causes, Song said, noting that this will enable China to shoulder its necessary responsibility in regional and global security.The revised national defense law also embodies the concept that everyone should be involved in national defense, the CMC official said.All national organizations, armed forces, political parties, civil groups, enterprises, social organizations and other organizations should support and take part in the development of national defense, fulfill national defense duties and carry out national defense missions according to the law, the official said, noting that all citizens should enhance their ideas in national defense and improve their national defense skills.Other changes to the law include adjustments to the function and power of national organizations, enrichment of missions and the development goals of armed forces, designation of defense policies in major security fields based on the needs of activities and interests in new security fields, and additions to policies in foreign military relations, Xinhua reported.
