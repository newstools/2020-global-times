Two satellites for the detection of gravitational waves are launched by a Long March-11 carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province, Dec. 10, 2020. China sent two satellites for the detection of gravitational waves into planned orbit from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center on Thursday morning. The two satellites, which compose the Gravitational Wave High-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) mission, were launched by a Long March-11 carrier rocket at 4:14 a.m. (Beijing Time), according to the center.

The Long March-11 rocket is developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
