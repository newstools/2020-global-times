On a busy street corner in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, an open-air training camp for female weight lifters has been inspiring women to reach the top of the sport for two decades - smashing taboos in the process.

Ramadan's daughter Nahla and his son Nehad now manage the center, which does not receive any external funding.Zayed is planning to go to schools and universities as well as conduct panel discussions and workshops to highlight the challenges women face in the sport, and hopes to drum up some extra funding for the cash-strapped camp.According to the 2015 Global Gender Gap Index, Egypt ranks low in gender equity compared to other nations.The index, which measures disparities between men and women across countries, ranked Egypt 136th out of 145 nations."We are still struggling with the great challenge of women under-representation at workplaces in general and sport in particular - not to mention a sport like weight lifting," said Randa Fakhr El-Deen, a women's rights activist and executive director of the NGOs Union on Harmful Practices Against Women.Celebrating women champions not only serves to inspire women, but helps erode gender stereotypes, she added.Lift Like A Girl premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and won the Golden Dove for Best Film in the German Competition, Long Film category, at the International Leipzig Festival for Documentary and Animated Film in October.It also won three awards, including an audience award, at the 42nd Cairo International Film Festival, in December.Newspaper headline: ‘Lift like a girl’
