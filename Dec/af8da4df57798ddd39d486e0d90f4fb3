My parents were Jewish refugees from the Holocaust...and my rest of life was possible because that harbor was made available," said Tribe, now a professor at the Harvard Law School, Harvard University.Tens of thousands of Jewish refugees fled to Shanghai during the Second World War, and mostly settled in an area in the northern part of the Suzhou River. They escaped Nazi atrocities and established a deep friendship with the Chinese people.
