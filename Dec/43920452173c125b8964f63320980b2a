In addition, any foreign financial institution that facilitates a significant transaction with them could be subject to sanctions.The United States in October sanctioned Iran's ambassador to Iraq Iraj Masjedi for "acting for or on behalf of the IRGC-QF." U.S. State Department designated the IRGC-QF as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in April 2019.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month threatened that Washington would impose more sanctions against Iran in the coming weeks and months.In May 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the Iranian nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and reimposed harsh sanctions against Iran. In response, Tehran has gradually dropped some of its JCPOA commitments since May 2019.
