Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry Photo: VCGThe Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday refuted Western media reports claiming that China is in a rush to reach EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) by the end of 2020 in a bid to strengthen China-EU relations ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration, stressing that China's stance towards China-EU relations has been clear and constant.As the international situation changes, China and the EU should embrace dialogue and cooperation in a bid to appropriately control and handle differences to ensure steady and sustained development of China-EU relations and inject more stability to the world, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a press briefing.He stated that the two sides' cooperation outweighs competition, while consensus outweighs difference.The comment came as some Western media outlets reported that China has made key market-access concessions this week so as to reach an agreement on the historic deal by the year's end.In addition, some reported that there are voices within the EU demanding the European Parliament refuse to acknowledge the deal unless China makes commitments on the so-called "forced labor" in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.Wang said that there is absolutely no so-called "forced labor" in Xinjiang. "Relevant reports are groundless and smear on Xinjiang," he stressed.Recently, China has stated its position on issues relating to Xinjiang many times. "As we've made clear, the human rights of residents of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are protected and the region has achieved positive progress in economic and social development. The biases and smears of certain organizations have no factual basis," Wang said at a press briefing last week.Despite external disruptions, China and the EU are boosting dialogue and cooperation. On Monday, the head of the EU Delegation to China, Ambassador Nicolas Chapuis, and the ambassadors of the EU member states held their annual working lunch with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing.They discussed a wide range of issues. Chapuis recalled the goal of finalizing negotiations for the CAI by the end of 2020 and noted the progress in the ongoing talks and that both sides are in continuous contact to address outstanding issues.Â The European Union remains committed to building a comprehensive relationship with China, taking into account the EU's interests and values, and based on mutual commitment and reciprocity, the Delegation of the European Union to China said in a press release sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.Newspaper headline: FM refutes Western reports on EU-China CAI
