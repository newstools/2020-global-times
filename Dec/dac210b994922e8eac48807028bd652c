Data from the US Trade Representative's Office showed that China bought 8.7 million tons of US corn as of October, an all-time high, and record levels of soybeans."In the medium to long term, China will continue to rely on imports for some agricultural products, such as soybeans," Li said, adding that with the phase one deal, much of the massive demand will be filled with US purchases. However, imports will also depend on the prices of US products. News of China's early soybean purchases helped lift export prices to the highest in six years, according to Reuters. "If prices for US agricultural products are too high, then naturally the eventual imports will not be as big," Li said, adding that the US should ensure steady supplies, while removing hurdles, such as tariffs, to lower costs for Chinese buyers.US President-elect Joe Biden has stated that he would not immediately remove tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese products, dimming prospects for a timely resolution of the ongoing tariff war. However, analysts also say that both sides will likely seek a way to phase out the bruising tariffs, which are opposed by many businesses in the US and around the world."Both factors [market demand and price, and implementation of the phase one deal] show" that China will significantly increase imports of US agricultural products, Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
