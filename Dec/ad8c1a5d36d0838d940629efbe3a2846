This year's outbreak during the Spring Festival, however, will not repeat next year as China has gained enough experience in preventing and controlling the disease.According to a notice about the New Year and Spring Festival holidays issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and China's State Council on Thursday, governments across the country have to be under constant guard to prevent imported cases and rebound of domestic cases and reduce people's mobility and gatherings during the two major holidays.

Many are worried that the Spring Festival travel rush, the world's biggest human migration, may bring a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China.Some Chinese people said they will cancel their travel plans and stay where they were to avoid possible infections during the travel rush, and some said they will go back home ahead of time.
