But as China is facing increasing security risks and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force is becoming more capable, China’s long-range strategic patrols will also gradually become more frequent, which is a common practice among major powers and is in line with international law, the analyst said.China increased the number of H-6Ks from two to four for this year’s joint patrol, a sign of the increasing capability of the PLA Air Force, said Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert.As more joint patrols are set in the future, the scale of these patrols could increase, and more types of aircraft, including aerial tankers that could extend the range of other participating aircraft, Fu said, noting that the PLA has conducted strategic patrols on its own, and conducting joint patrols with Russia will further improve its capability in high seas, honing the ability to safeguard maritime interests and national and regional security.Fu said that only three countries now operate long-range strategic bombers. The other is the US. China and Russia’s joint strategic patrols will contribute to mutual trust, and the two sides can learn to deal with regional security situations together.The joint aerial strategic patrols are arranged to further develop the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, enhance the strategic cooperation level and joint operation capability of the two countries’ militaries, and safeguard the global strategic stability, the Chinese Defense Ministry said in the statement.Joint aerial patrols by strategic bombers used to be rare, but as they become more frequent in the future, the world will get used to it, Fu said.
