MOFCOM would continue to work on deepening economic and trade ties with Pakistan, he said. At a meeting before the award ceremony, officials from MOFCOM and diplomats from the Pakistani Embassy agreed to further promote Pakistan-China trade and economic relations in line with the consensus reached between leaders of both countries and for the benefit of the two peoples.Pakistan's exports to China increased by 30 percent year-on-year in November, improving the trade balance between the two countries, according to the Thursday edition of the English-language Express Tribune, a Pakistani daily newspaper. In November, Pakistan presented at CAEXPO as a Special Partner Country for the first time. The country will retain this designation at the 18th CAEXPO in 2021.In August, the bilateral import and export volume of goods between China and Pakistan reached $1.4 billion, according to data released by China's General Administration of Customs.
