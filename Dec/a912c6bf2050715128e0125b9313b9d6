The report has attributed accelerated growth to the country's effective epidemic-control moves, strong policy support and resilient export volumes.Â China's GDP in the third quarter of 2020 expanded 4.9 percent, causing the economy to bounce back into the positive territory of 0.7 percent growth for the first three quarters, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Analysts predicted that the rate in the fourth quarter will climb to around 6 percent on a yearly basis.
