The ongoing Discovery exhibition hosted by Art Beijing Photo: Courtesy of Ye NanArt Beijing, one of China's prominent art expos, is hosting an exhibition to mark the year 2020, the festival's 15th anniversary. The occasion was originally scheduled to be celebrated with a grand expo in May and October, but Art Beijing had to scale back these ambitious plans due to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. According to Dong Mengyang, founder of Art Beijing, the sudden arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted cultural industries around the globe. "It is far more important to regain our confidence in the future," said Dong, who hopes the ongoing exhibition will uplift people's spirit. Featuring a number of Chinese artists, the Discovery exhibition is comprised of three sections that include contemporary and classic art.  Dong also announced that two new versions of Art Beijing will be held in the spring and autumn of 2021. The autumn version will be open to art agents, a first for the expo. According to Zhao Yini, executive director of Art Beijing, art agents play an important role in connecting artists and the market, but are often overlooked. Art Beijing will attempt to become a platform to raise their visibility.
