But the central bank has claimed that provisions including Lebanon's Banking Secrecy Law prevent it from releasing some of the necessary information."After approving a law that lifts banking secrecy... we can begin a forensic audit," said Hasan Fadlallah, a lawmaker affiliated with the powerful Shiite Hezbollah movement. The country, which defaulted on its debt in 2020, is experiencing its worst economic crisis.Newspaper headline: Lebanon parliament clears way for forensic audit
