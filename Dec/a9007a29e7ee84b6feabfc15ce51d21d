But the Japanese public do not appear convinced.A poll published on Monday by the Jiji press agency similarly found 21 percent favoring a cancellation and nearly 30 percent a further delay. And a Kyodo news agency poll published December 6 also found a total of 61.2 percent opposed to holding the Games in 2021.The figure comes with just over seven months to go until the postponed Games are scheduled to open.Â The start of vaccination campaigns in some parts of the world has boosted the confidence of organizers that the Games can go ahead, though inoculation will not be mandatory for athletes or spectators.
