Opponents of Nepal's prime minister turned to the Supreme Court on Monday to challenge his dissolution of parliament and the calling of an election.Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's dissolution of parliament on Sunday raises the prospect of months of political turmoil in the Himalayan country as it battles the novel coronavirus.Seven government ministers stepped down after Oli's dissolution, saying it was violation of the "popular mandate" given to them in a 2017 general election. Supreme Court spokesperson Bhadrakali Pokharel said three petitions against the dissolution were "in the process of being registered.""Under the constitution, the prime minister has no prerogative to dissolve parliament," said lawyer Dinesh Tripathi, who is one of the petitioners. The president on Sunday set April 30 and May 10 as dates for the general election - more than a year ahead of schedule - on the advice of Oli's cabinet.The prime minister has recently lost support within his own Nepal Communist Party, with some members accusing him of sidelining the party in government decisions and shunning members when making key appointments.His supporters say that in a democracy, a new election is the best way out of a crisis like this.The strife comes as Nepal battles the coronavirus. Nepal has had 253,772 infections and 1,788 deaths and the pandemic has battered its tourism-and-remittance-dependent economy.If the court registers the petitions, it could take about two weeks for a decision, legal experts say.
