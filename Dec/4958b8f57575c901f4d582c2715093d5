As close neighbors that cannot physically move away from each other, Palestinians and Israelis must adhere to the strategic option of peace talks and relaunch equal-footed dialogue without delay, said Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations. China welcomes the initiative of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to convene an international peace conference early next year, and commends the two parties for restarting civil and security cooperation and resuming the transfer of tax revenues, he told a Security Council meeting on the Middle East. International players must remain impartial and objective, and work in good faith to advance the Middle East peace process. Any solution to the Palestinian question must heed the voices of regional countries, especially the Palestinians, accommodate the concerns of all parties, and must not be imposed on any party, he said. The relevant UN resolutions, the land-for-peace principle, and the two-state solution, which represents the wisdom and painstaking work of generations, must be observed and implemented, said Geng.
