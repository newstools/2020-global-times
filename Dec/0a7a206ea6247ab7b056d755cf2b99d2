They were later released pending appeal.Now a resident of Germany, he had faced up to 35 years in jail for allegedly supporting terrorism and military or political espionage.Dundar's lawyers refused to attend the final hearing. "We do not want to be part of a practice to legitimize a previously decided, political verdict," they said in a written statement ahead of the hearing.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas criticized the ruling as a "hard blow against independent journalistic work in Turkey" which he called a fundamental right."Journalism is not a crime but an indispensable service to society - even and especially when it looks critically... on the fingers of those in power," Maas told RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland.Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency's communications director, said on Twitter Dundar's sentence does not violate freedom of expression. Writing in German, he said Turkey expects its partners to accept the decision and extradite him.ReutersNewspaper headline: Turkish journalist gets 27 years for espionage
