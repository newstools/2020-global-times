More than 60,000 people getting injections have gone to high-risk areas outside China, and no infection has been reported so far, Zheng Zhongwei, director of the Development Center for Medical Science and Technology of the National Health Commission (NHC), said at the conference.Nearly 1 million people have been vaccinated voluntarily. China has carried out phase I, II and III clinical trials, which have demonstrated that Chinese vaccines are safe. "There are some minor adverse reactions, but no serious ones," Zheng said.China has five COVID-19 vaccines entering phase III clinical trials. But some barriers slowed down the pace of China's phase III trials, such as the easing of epidemic in China, communication gaps overseas, and the inexperience of Chinese producers in global cooperation, but China always follows scientific standards, said health officials at the press conference on Monday.China-developed vaccines can produce antibodies in two weeks. They need to cover around 70 percent of the population to reach herd immunity against the novel coronavirus, health officials said, appealing for the public to take the vaccines..Health officials warned there might be some reactions such as fever, ache or fatigue after being vaccinated, but there is no need to worry. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that the risks of epidemic spread during the New Year and Spring Festival holidays are rising. Wu hinted that the risk of infection caused by the purchase or consumption of imported cold-chain food is very low as positive nucleic acid test result on cold-chain food doesn't imply there is infectivity. Global Times
