The US kicked off a mass vaccination drive on Monday hoping to turn the tide on the world's biggest coronavirus outbreak, as the nation's death toll passed a staggering 300,000.The start of the desperately awaited vaccine program coincided with several European countries announcing new lockdowns amid spiraling infections, highlighting the long road to ending the global pandemic.

A total of 145 sites were to receive vaccines Monday, 425 on Tuesday and 66 on Wednesday.

Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!" President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter earlier in the day, while President-elect Joe Biden tweeted "Stay hopeful - brighter days ahead." Vaccinations also took place in California, Pennsylvania and Ohio, while Canada administered its first dose to a caregiver in Montreal.An initial 2.9 million doses are set to be delivered to 636 sites around the country by Wednesday, with officials saying 20 million Americans could receive the two-shot regimen by year end, and 100 million by March.Â Doses are being shipped in boxes containing dry ice that can keep supplies at -70 C, the temperature needed to preserve the Pfizer-BioNTech drug. Trials have shown the vaccine to be 95 percent effective. But experts face a battle to convince enough Americans to take it to make it effective in a country where the anti-vaccine movement is strong.Also launching vaccinations Monday was the United Arab Emirates which began administering shots by Chinese drugs giant Sinopharm in Abu Dhabi.Newspaper headline: First Americans receive vaccine
