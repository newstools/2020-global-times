It said that it is “dismayed” to learn that Alibaba Cloud developed the facial recognition technology in a testing environment. “We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups, and we have eliminated any ethnic tags in our product offering,” Alibaba said in the statement. It also noted that the trial technology was not deployed by any of its customers. “We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to target or identify specific ethnic groups.” Global Times
