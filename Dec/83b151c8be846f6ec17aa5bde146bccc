Businesses found in violation of COVID-19 regulations face fines up to 10,000 U.S. dollars per violation, while egregious violations can result in the immediate suspension of a bar or restaurant's liquor license, it said.Seven establishments' liquor licenses were suspended for illegally operating in state-designated micro-cluster zones, which are subject to stronger restrictions due to increased COVID-19 spread in the community, it added."New York still has one of the country's lowest infection rates and that is a testament to the toughness and unity of New Yorkers all doing what they can to limit spread. Unfortunately, however, some establishments have continued to ignore the rules, putting their customers, as well as their community as a whole, at risk," Governor Andrew Cuomo was quoted as saying."If we let our guard down and ignore basic public health rules, this winter could be one of the darkest periods of this pandemic and we simply cannot let that happen. We know the vaccine is on the way, we know there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but if we let up now and become undisciplined, it's going to take us even longer to get there," he added.State Liquor Authority Chair Vincent Bradley said, "As we move into the colder weather and are forced indoors, it is imperative that businesses stay compliant across the state. New Yorkers must continue wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and following the life-saving protocols put into place to keep us all healthy."The State Liquor Authority continues enforcement efforts statewide, with a specific focus on areas with dramatic increases in COVID-19 cases, including state-designated micro-cluster zones, according to the release.As of Tuesday afternoon, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University reported 35,063 coronavirus deaths in New York state, the worst in the country.
