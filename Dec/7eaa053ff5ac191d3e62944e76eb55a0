This means that upon detecting a hostile submarine, the aircraft can proceed to directly drop a weapon of choice to attack it without requesting other warships or submarines to do so, the article said.Compared with a torpedo, a depth charge is less powerful, but is much smaller and cheaper, the magazine said, noting that the use of this new type of depth charge, together with air-droppable torpedoes, will greatly increase the Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft's combat efficiency and flexibility, and be highly effective in potential future battles against the military on the island of Taiwan.According to the defense authority on the island of Taiwan, the Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft has been one of the most frequent visitors near the Taiwan island since mid-September, when the PLA carried out a large-scale maritime and aerial exercise near the Taiwan Straits.In late November, Taiwan island held a high-profile ceremony marking the start of construction for its new submarine fleet, which will purportedly be able to counter the Chinese mainland.Displaying the Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft's exercises with its new weapon could be seen as a warning to Taiwan secessionists, as it demonstrates the PLA's capability in dealing with underwater threats in the Taiwan Straits, a Chinese mainland military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Sunday.Any attempts to use force to resist reunification will be futile, the expert said.Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times that the mainland can monitor submarine movements in the Taiwan Straits, and Taiwan submarines will not be able to have a very big impact.
