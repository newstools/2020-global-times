Police officers intervene past a burning barricade during a demonstration for "social rights" and against the "global security" draft law in Paris, France on Saturday. Photo: AFPViolence erupted in Paris on Saturday for the second consecutive weekend at a mass protest against a new security law, with demonstrators clashing with police, vehicles set alight and shop windows smashed.The weekly nationwide protests are becoming a major headache for President Emmanuel Macron's government, with tensions intensified by the beating of a black music producer by police in November.However, the numbers were less than half this Saturday with the nationwide figure at 52,350 against 133,000 a week earlier, the interior ministry said.Around 5,000 people demonstrated in Paris against 46,000 last week, it added.Members of the so-called yellow vests movement, which shook Macron with protests against a lack of equality in France over the winter of 2018-19, were also prominent in the rally.Windows of a supermarket, property agency and bank were broken while several cars were in flames along Avenue Gambetta as thousands of demonstrators marched toward the central Place de la Republique, AFP reporters said.Objects were also thrown at police who responded by using tear gas, in a repeat of the violent scenes from the protests last weekend against the security law that would restrict publication of pictures showing the faces of police.Some demonstrators used objects left in the streets to create impromptu barricades that they then set on fire. A bank was ransacked by protesters who broke inside and brought out papers that they burned in the street.Protesters, some letting off smoke bombs and firecrackers, shouted slogans including "Everyone hates the police."AFP
