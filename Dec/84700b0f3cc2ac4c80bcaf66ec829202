Future editions of Yellow Lounge China will also feature such global classical stars as Daniil Trifonov, Andreas Ottensamer and Víkingur Ólafsson, once international touring resumes.Internationally renowned classical guitarist Yang Xuefei will open the program on December 20 in company with Lu Yiwen, a virtuoso performer on erhu, better known in the West as the Chinese violin. Their set will include the exquisite "Fisherman's Song by Moonlight."The show will continue with a slow movement from Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in D minor Op.49, performed by pianist Serena Wang, violinist Paloma So and cellist Namisa Sun, before Daniel Hope joins the party online to play Elgar's "Salut d'amour" with Pianist Niu Niu.Most of these performers are still in their teens, a fact that highlights Deutsche Grammophon's commitment to supporting the next generation of classical musicians.Yellow Lounge China will be housed in the Blackstone complex, an urban site redeveloped as a musical hub close to Symphony Hall in Shanghai's historic French Concession.Dickon Stainer, president and CEO of Universal Classics and Jazz, welcomes the latest extension of the Yellow Lounge initiative. "I'm delighted to see Yellow Lounge finding a new home in Shanghai as a result of some excellent teamwork between Universal Music China, Deutsche Grammophon and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and Long Yu [Yu Long]. I know this new venue will inspire innovative and vibrant music-making by talented young artists from China and around the world," he said to Universal Music China.Yu, a Chinese conductor acclaimed for his work in China and on the international stage, will serve as Yellow Lounge China's ambassador and curator. "Every musician knows how important it is to encourage the next generation of classical performers," the conductor told media."But it's also vital to create a new audience and allow young people to feel at home when they come to a concert. Over the past 20 years, Yellow Lounge has transformed the way classical musicians connect with their audiences. I am delighted to see Yellow Lounge China come to Shanghai and look forward to welcoming many more young people to our classical club nights," he added.
