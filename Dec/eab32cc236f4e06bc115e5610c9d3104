It now “lives” in the No.2 pit in the museum, as the ID card shows.Zhao said in the show that each of 1,300 figures excavated has its own file, like an ID card of a real person. He has been taking portrait photos for the warriors to update their files, which he said was like taking photos for their ID cards.“Just like the seventh population census that is ongoing in our country, we are adding new materials into the files of these warriors,” Zhao said.So far, Zhao has taken portrait photos for 862 of the 1,300 figures."When you see their eyes through the lens, you can feel they are breathing. The moment you stand in front of them, they are not the Terracotta Warriors but our ancestors," Zhao said in the show.
