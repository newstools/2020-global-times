The incident marks the first time that COVID-19 was reported on local cold chain food products from local sources in China. The case was found in Wuxi of East China's Jiangsu Province, instead of Chuzhou, a staff from Chuzhou's epidemic control team told the Global Times on Wednesday. Wuxi's epidemic control team issued a letter asking Chuzhou to help with the investigation, he said.It is still unknown how the package was contaminated as of press time, but it is likely to have been contaminated by the packaging of imported food products during cold chain transportation, an immunology expert, who asked to be not named, told the Global Times on Wednesday."If it is proved so, we need to strengthen disinfection in cold chain logistics and separate the transportation of domestic products and imported ones," the expert said.The Global Times learned that Anhui's Center for Disease Control and Prevention has sent experts to Lai'an to join the investigation.The drumsticks were purchased from a protein company in Laian county of Chuzhou, the Lai'an epidemic control team said. The company is owned by US food giant Cargill, the staff confirmed.The local authority has started conducting nucleic acid testing among all company staff members as well as in relevant places. So far, 2,712 samples of nucleic acid testing have been collected, among which 2,313 returned negative; 399 are awaiting their results.Besides, no positive test results were found in all 267 samples taken from cold chain transport vehicles, office spaces, cold storage, production lines and food.
