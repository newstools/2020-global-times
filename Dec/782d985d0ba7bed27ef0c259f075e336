That figure is largely in line with the IMF's latest forecast of a 1.9-percent full-year growth rate for the Chinese economy, which is expected to be the only major economy in the world to post growth for the year.During the meeting with the IMF chief, Li also said that the IMF has played a key role in promoting free trade and economic development and should continue to strive for building multilateral consensus. As the world's biggest developing nation, China is willing to make appropriate contributions to that, Li said.In the meeting, Georgieva said that the IMF appreciates China's important role in global trade, economic recovery and poverty reduction and is willing to strengthen cooperation with China to jointly safeguard multilateralism, according to the Chinese statement.
