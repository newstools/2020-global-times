Innovation has always been a hallmark of musician Damon Albarn and illustrator Jamie Hewlett's cartoon band Gorillaz, and now they are aiming to pull off something new in a series of live concerts that audiences can pay to stream into their homes.

But what else can we offer people at this moment in time that's value for money and also artistically kind of adventurous and retains the spirit of what live music is and what must not be lost?"Albarn hopes that in the summer of 2021 live concerts and festivals will be able to take place again in Britain, but if the wait goes on for much longer, live music culture could change."We stand perilously on the abyss of a digital avatar where you know, we slowly become insignificant," he warned.The year 2020 saw the launch of Gorillaz's Song Machine audiovisual project - a series of self-contained episodes that ended up becoming an album."I just wanted to do something that was sort of much more spontaneous and had the ability to be far more flexible and fluid," Albarn said.Reflecting on the creation of Gorillaz 22 years ago, Albarn said his animated band exceeded his expectations and enabled them to not be "shackled by the usual things that get in the way with bands after a long period of time."Albarn dismissed recent rumors that he might have a track to release featuring Paul McCartney, explaining that it was just a small recording he had from when they once jammed together after dinner."I never said that I had a tune or anything," said Albarn.Gorillaz's three performances are set to take place from London on Saturday and Sunday.Newspaper headline: ‘Strange Timez’
