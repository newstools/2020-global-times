A maritime rescue boat will also be established alongside basic medical equipment. What's more, combined rescue drills and patrols by both land and maritime departments will be conducted in the future.Official data shows that over 100 maritime accidents that require help from the police occur every year; the wounded are often in critical situations, suffering from trauma, fractures and drowning. In the past, the police would normally send the victims to the wharf with an ambulance waiting; however, this often wasted valuable time, especially in cases where persons go into respiratory arrest.Â
