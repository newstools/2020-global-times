Facing a demand for an apology, Chinese artist Wuheqilin creates a new illustration in response to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Photo: WuheqilinAs a war of words about an illustration featuring an Australian soldier murdering a child continues to escalate online, floods of Chinese rejected Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's "fake and malicious" accusation, and his remarks were deemed by observers as a tool to stoke domestic nationalist resentment toward China.As the farce created by Morrison, who asked China to apologize for an illustration showing an Australian solider killing an Afghan child, became more intense, Hua Chunying, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on Tuesday that Morrison's accusation is groundless, noting that the circulating illustration is not a photograph but a computer-generated artwork created by a Chinese cartoonist.The illustration is based on an investigation report by the Australian Department of Defense, Hua pointed out, noting that "although it is a painting, it reflects the facts."Hua said that Morrison's real purpose is clear, and that is to divert attention and shift pressure from Australian war crimes to criticism of China.Some Australian politicians and certain other Australians show inexplicable, unreasonable arrogance and hypocrisy, Hua said. They are trying to deprive China of its right to tell the truth as they are afraid of the truth, she noted.Hua on Monday rejected Morrison's demand, saying that the Australian government should feel "ashamed" for the crimes committed by its soldiers in Afghanistan.Following Morrison, the Australian Embassy in China took to Chinese social media to call the illustration "fake" and forwarded Morrison's remarks on the issue. The malicious and groundless accusations sparked a backlash among Chinese netizens."The picture is indeed a fake. You [Australian soldiers] killed two children. The cartoonist only drew one," a netizen wrote mockingly, and the comment had been liked over 35,000 times as of press time.Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Tuesday that "This reveals Morrison's cowardice and lack of a sense of responsibility as a fully independent statesman."Chen said "There is a clear-cut distinction between a piece of art and a faked photo." "Morrison deliberately mischaracterized the computer-generated artwork as a fake photo to stoke domestic nationalist resentment toward China, using the tweet to deflect international public indignation at the Australian soldiers' atrocities in Afghanistan," Chen said.Meanwhile, Morrison has been trying to play down the event.
