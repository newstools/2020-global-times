"pork prices which have fallen sharply have pulled down food prices overall," he explained.With the recent positive COVID-19 results found in cold-storage facilities, consumers are cautious when selecting imported cold-chain goods, which also contributed to the decline in the food prices, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Core CPI for November, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.5 percent year-on-year, the same increase for the last five consecutive months according to Dong, the senior statistician at the NBS.The growth in the core CPI reflects a rebound in China's service sector and consumption, said Liu, noting that China's CPI will likely see positive growth before the second quarter of 2021, as the country's recovery gathers speed.But due to a recent outbreak of new case in parts of China, authorities will continue to enforce health and safety measures to control he epidemic, this will likely lead to a decline in consumption including in the tourism, catering, and transportation sectors, Dong said, the director.In November, China's producer price index (PPI) fell 1.5 percent year-on-year, narrowing from 2.1 percent in the October. PPI measures the cost of raw materials to companies that produce goods, according to NBS data.In November, industrial production recovered steadily, market demand and industrial product prices continued to rise," said Dong, the statistician."Following China's economic recovery, and the fact that the coronavirus pandemic has gradually been brought under control, it is expected that PPI will continue to pick up, and will possibly return to positive growth in the second quarter of 2021," said Liu.According to a survey of 40 major industrial sectors, prices rose in 24 sectors, an increase of 12 sectors compared with October, mainly driven by the energy sector, according to the NBS.Global Times
