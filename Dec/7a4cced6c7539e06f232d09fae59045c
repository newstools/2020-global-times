A nearly "zero-emissions" building site in Oslo, using electric machinery, could be a pioneer for greener construction as the world's urban areas swell by the equivalent of a Dublin, Ireland or Dallas, the US every week, city experts say.

People cut down Christmas trees to be given to London in Oslo, Norway on November 17.

Fossil-fuel cars have been banned in much of the area, which includes special chargers for electric taxis.Mølmen said the revamp project has saved 35,000 liters of diesel fuel and 99 percent of greenhouse gas emissions compared to a conventional building site.The project cost 64 million crowns ($7.2 million), compared to an estimated 59 million for a more traditional project, largely because electric machines are scarce and currently cost more.The "zero emissions" standard used was more stringent than a previous "fossil-free" regulation in Oslo that allowed the use of biodiesel engines.Norway generates almost all its electricity from hydropower.Oslo leads the global "clean construction forum" for C40, whose members include big cities such as Beijing, New York, Tokyo, London and Paris.In one C40 initiative in November, Oslo, Los Angeles, Mexico City and Budapest jointly pledged to halve emissions from building sites by 2030.The world's construction industry accounts for more than 23 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, C40 said, so any cuts will help nations meet goals they set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.Urban growthThe UN's panel of climate scientists said in its most recent assessment in 2014 that more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas "and each week the global urban population increases by 1.3 million." That means adding urban areas the size of Islamabad, Harare, Dublin or Dallas every week or so. Sutherland at C40 said priorities for green construction include upgrading existing buildings, rather than demolishing and re-building, improving designs and using better materials, such as recycled steel or low-emissions concrete.Oslo's "zero emissions" policy seeks to cover all work within the perimeter of building sites. But a lack of specialized electric machinery from suppliers means the municipality sometimes grants exemptions and permits machines that use fossil fuels.In its recent project, the municipality allowed a diesel crane onto the site, for instance, after failing to find an electric one. It burned 16 liters of fuel. Also, asphalt laid at the site was by diesel-powered machines.Among suppliers, Norwegian construction equipment producer Nasta refits excavators built by Hitachi with batteries, enabling them to operate for about four hours before running flat.A city's ambitionNorway, Western Europe's top oil exporter with a $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund built on fossil-fuel wealth, paradoxically also has some of the globe's most progressive environmental policies.Those have created, for instance, the highest rate of electric car ownership in the world. In the first 11 months of 2020, 52 percent of all new cars sold in Norway were electric, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.Oslo's vice mayor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg, of the Green Party, said cities can often be more ambitious than national governments because voters see the results of climate policies in their daily lives - more parks, cleaner air and cycling lanes. A problem is defining where the city's authority ends and less stringent national building codes - which allow fossil fuels to take over.Currently, Oslo only demands emissions-free construction on sites it controls, from roads to kindergartens."Four of five construction sites in Oslo are private or state owned," Berg said, adding the city recently wrote to the center-right government saying it wanted to demand that all sites in Oslo are zero-emissions or fossil-free.It has not yet received a reply.Among other green changes in the city in recent years, the percentage of electric vehicles passing toll points into Oslo has risen to 25 percent of all cars from 6 percent in 2015. Diesel cars pay a toll five times higher than electric cars. The municipality has built 55 kilometers of cycling roads since 2015, after only about 15 kilometers were added in the previous decade. More than 100 electric buses operate in Oslo and surrounding areas.Those changes have stirred hostility from some car drivers. A new single-issue party, campaigning to abolish road tolls, won nearly 6 percent of the vote in 2019 municipal elections in Oslo. Despite its greener policies, Oslo has fallen far short of a headline-grabbing goal in 2016 to halve the city's greenhouse emissions by 2020.Under revised, less ambitious goals, Oslo estimates emissions in 2020 will be 25 percent below 2009 levels. Those are about 1.4 million tons.Newspaper headline: Building greener
