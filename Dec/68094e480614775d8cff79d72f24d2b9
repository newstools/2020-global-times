Its main purpose is to meet the need for a higher level of opening-up while preventing national security risks.Globally speaking, it is a common practice for countries to conduct security reviews and screen foreign investment that affects or may affect national security. For instance, the US issued the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, the EU released the Foreign Direct Investment Regulation and Australia issued the Foreign Investment Reform.Global Times
