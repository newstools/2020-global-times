"Two Bombs" refers to the atomic bomb (and later the hydrogen bomb) and the ICBM, while "One Satellite" refers to the artificial satellite. His strategic vision greatly boosted the industrial development of China, Zhou noted.

The reentry capsule of the Shenzhou-10 manned spacecraft was officially handed over to Shaoshan in Central China’s Hunan Province – the birthplace of late Chinese leader Mao Zedong on Friday, a day ahead of the 127th anniversary of Mao’s birth. Photo: IC The reentry capsule of the Shenzhou-10 manned spacecraft, launched in 2013, was handed over to Shaoshan in Central China's Hunan Province, known as Mao's birthplace. Placing the reentry capsule of the Shenzhou-10 crewed spacecraft at his hometown is the best tribute to the late Chinese leader, Zhou noted, saying "It is the product and representation of the Chinese people's red culture in the modern era.""We can now report to the late Chinese leader that we have made it, we have made his vision a reality," Zhou said. Mao approved the Shuguang-1 manned space project on July 14, 1970, which paved the way for following manned space projects.Shuguang-1 is commonly referred to by its establishment date of July 14 as the "714 Project," as opposed to the Shenzhou series "921 Project."
China's manned space missions have come a long way through generations since the "714 Project," independently achieving multiple technological breakthroughs including the success of unmanned flight experiments to manned missions and the docking of numerous spacecraft.
