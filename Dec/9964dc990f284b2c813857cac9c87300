As the UK braces for the end of the Brexit transition period, the Northern Irish town of Warrenpoint reflects on four years at the heart of Britain's turbulent departure from the EU.A port hub humming with ferries and freight, Warrenpoint sits on the Irish border and was the site of the deadliest attack on British troops during "The Troubles."Since the 2016 vote to leave the EU, all those elements became shuffling pieces in the intractable puzzle of Britain's bid to split with the bloc."Unfortunately we are very much in Warrenpoint right at the center of a whole plethora of issues, historic and recent, around Brexit," said Mark Kelly, head of the town's chamber of commerce.

What are we getting ready for?"Newspaper headline: Blurred barriers
