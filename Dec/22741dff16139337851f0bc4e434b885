When excluding companies that selected their main country, UK companies' preference for China was even more apparent, it said.Companies in several sectors such as vehicles, chemicals, information technology, technology and telecoms see China as the supply partner of choice, the survey said.China remains an important offshore base for manufacturing, and 21 percent of companies in the survey listed China in the top three locations where production sites are based (excluding their main country of location), it said.Global companies could continue to consider establishing production sites in China to provide for the country's large and growing domestic demand, and as authorities continue to loosen restrictions in order to attract foreign direct investment.China's supply chains will be more resilient in the next five years with complete manufacturing systems, Zhao Ping, vice president of the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, told Global Times. She added that although China's labor costs may rise in the long term, total costs will be competitive compared with other countries because of high production efficiency, lower logistics costs, continuing research and development of products, a huge market, and a stable political environment.Newspaper headline: China most attractive supplier worldwide as restrictions ease, global survey finds
