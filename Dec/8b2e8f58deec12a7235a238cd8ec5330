A German court is to hand down its verdict Monday on a deadly far-right attack in Halle in 2019 that nearly became the country's worst anti-Semitic atrocity since World War II.

His defense team has asked presiding judge Ursula Mertens only for a "fair sentence."Lohse said Balliet had acted on the basis of a "racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic ideology" to carry out an attack against not only those he killed but "Jewish life in Germany as a whole."The events that unfolded were like a "nightmare," he added."At the end of this nightmare, the perpetrator murdered two people and injured and traumatized numerous others."During the trial, Balliet insisted that "attacking the synagogue was not a mistake, they are my enemies."Dressed in military garb, he filmed the attack and broadcast it on the internet, prefacing it with a manifesto espousing his misogynist, neo-fascist ideology.The attack bore some of the hallmarks of two carried out and similarly live-streamed some months earlier in Christchurch, New Zealand by Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people. Balliet cited Tarrant as an inspiration.He has been charged with two counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder in a case that has deeply rattled the country and fuelled fears about rising right-wing extremism and anti-Jewish violence, 75 years after the end of the Nazi era.Newspaper headline: German verdict due in deadly anti-Semitic rampage
