And it is essential for the two countries to review the experience of mutually beneficial cooperation, reflect on the lessons of the low ebb of bilateral ties in recent years, and rebuild the strategic framework for healthy and stable development, which is also based on the fundamental interests of the two countries' peoples and common well-being of all countries.Wang called for a resumption of China-US dialogue, which is an effective way to correctly understand each other's strategic intentions as well as internal and external policies.  "China is ready to open a dialogue with the US on an equal footing at all levels and in all fields for candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges. We are striving for common ground while reserving differences, and prudently managing differences," said Wang. In order to restart cooperation, Wang called for bilateral cooperation in the field of anti-pandemic efforts. He said the two countries also have the responsibility to strengthen communication on other major issues such as the global economy, climate change, counter-terrorism and cyber issues, in order to bolster global peace, stability and economic recovery.Wang also emphasized mutual trust as the premise of healthy and stable development of China-US ties, noting that the US should not regard China as a threat, but instead view China's development with a positive and constructive attitude."We always believe that as long as we keep an objective and rational attitude, increase mutual understanding and integrate our interests, we will be able to find a way for countries with different social systems and cultural backgrounds to coexist peacefully on this planet," Wang said. Wang Chen, a senior Chinese legislator on the US' sanctions list, called on Thursday for American companies to make positive efforts in putting China-US relations back-on-track.China will insist on opening up at a higher level, ease market access and ensure that companies registered in China are treated equally, he said. Global Times
