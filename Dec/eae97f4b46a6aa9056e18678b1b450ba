"We did it: A 'Ratatousical' is coming on January 1st, 2021!"It's unclear who exactly will be involved in the final piece, though artists with actual Broadway credits are said to be taking part.Â Which songs will make the cut for the final show will also be a surprise, but the original "Ode to Remy" is sure to appear, with other options including "Tango for Colette and Linguini," "Trash is our Treasure" and "Anyone Can Cook.""The love for the performing arts shines through in the Ratatouille-inspired TikToks from theater lovers around the world," said head of the Actors Fund Joseph Benincasa in a statement.He said the show "is sure to bring joy to arts lovers far and wide this holiday season, while at the same time will help raise much-needed funds for those in need in our entertainment and performing arts community."
