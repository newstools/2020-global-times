Russia and the UK announced on Wednesday they will start mass vaccinations against the coronavirus next week.Sun and Wang learned about COVID-19 vaccine research, visited production plants and checked preparation work, and fully affirmed the achievements of the vaccine developers.Fourteen vaccines using five technology methods are in clinical trials and five vaccines are undergoing phase Ⅲ clinical trials. Emergency use, production preparation and other work are proceeding in an orderly manner.Sun called for scientific and rigorous phase Ⅲ clinical trials  to carry out review and approval work in strict accordance with laws, regulations and internationally recognized technical standards to ensure the safety and effectiveness.She required Chinese companies prepare for mass production, strictly comply with laws, regulations, procedures and requirements on quality supervision and biosafety, improve the traceability system for vaccines, punish illegal activities for creating a favorable market environment.Sun said it's necessary to formulate a vaccination distribution plan before the vaccines are made available to the public. The emergency use of the vaccine in high-risk groups, such as port workers and front-line supervisors, will be completed by the end of 2020, she said.The UK's approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine on Wednesday paved the way for widespread uses of the vaccine. The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due to arrive in the coming days, Pfizer said.Analysts said the UK and Russia's quick approval for widespread use of vaccine is mainly in response to new outbreaks that may get worse during the coming winter. China is very likely to introduce its first officially approved vaccine for mass use in December, but whether it would be approved only for limited use is still under discussion, a Beijing-based immunological professor who asks not to be named told the Global Times.The first vaccines to get approval are likely the inactivated vaccine candidates from either Sinovac or state-owned Sinopharm, said the professor, noting that other frontrunner candidates such as recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine would be slightly behind or approved for emergency use first.The Global Times learned from the Sinovac's Brazilian partner Butantan Institute which is carrying out the phase Ⅲ clinical trials of the inactivated vaccine CoronaVac that the data from the trials have been sent to the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency. Sinovac told the Global Times that analysis of the clinical data will take some time.Compared to China, vaccines are more urgently needed in the West, said a Shanghai-based vaccine expert.
