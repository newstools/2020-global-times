"There is no time to lose."The plea for readiness came as the government also launched a new Border Operations Centre to be manned around the clock by a team of experts to monitor the UK border. It will rely on software that gathers information about the flow of goods and passengers in real time.Brexit supporters narrowly won the argument for leaving the EU in 2016 with a claim that this would restore Britain's control over its borders.But there are fears that the country's imminent departure from the bloc's single market and customs union after nearly 50 years could cause chaos at ports and logistics hubs.AFP
