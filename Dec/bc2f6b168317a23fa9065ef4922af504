Just like Zhang Yimou's One Second, they did not talk about the director's love for film stock, but rather focused on the released version being cut one minute shorter."He pointed out that many foreign media outlets have qualitatively determined an answer before asking the question, which is also asked with obvious hostility and malice.He gave the example that one French media outlet that recently asked him why the bad guys in Wolf Warrior 2 were all white people, which made Lü think that the outlet was trying to get him to say something about "racial discrimination.""But the truth is that we could only find some white actors at the time. Their question left me speechless," Lü sighed, adding that he was also once being asked some "ridiculous questions" such as whether the Chinese government invested in Wolf Warrior 2 and if it was the government that asked them to shoot the film. Time for a changeSome media overseas have also criticized the film for being "too nationalistic," which Lü thought is not a big deal compared with some Western films from countries such as the US that has made movies, in which the US president leads the American people to fight against evil aliens and save the Earth. "It seems that the world's rules are always made by the Western powers, but it is time for us to raise our own voice and our mainstream values. They can praise their heroes and we can use our own way to commemorate our heroes."Chinese patriotic films have been gaining ground on the international stage recently. Wolf Warrior 2 competed for Best International Feature Film at the 90th Academy Awards, while 2020 blockbuster sports film Leap is set to compete at the upcoming Oscars in 2021 according to the film's official Sina Weibo account, which can be seen as a means to show Chinese mainstream values to the world. For Lü, however, he says his current goal is not to win international awards but to just tell good Chinese stories.According to report, China's annual per capita audience of watching film is 1.23, which is far behind North America's 3.59 and South Korea's 4.24, and he believed that China still has a huge potential to develop its film industry.Talking about Western media's use of the expression "China's 'Wolf Warrior' diplomats," Lü said he never expected that the title of the film would be co-opted in such a way and that he disagrees with the media's usage of it. "China has a humiliating history of being invaded by others, but we still keep a modest and tolerant attitude toward others [foreign powers]. However, sometimes showing humility is seen as weakness, so we need to be tough and fight back against reactionary voices in the world," Lü said.Newspaper headline: Right to speak
