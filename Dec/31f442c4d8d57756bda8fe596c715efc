A strawberry-flavored tablet for children living with HIV will be rolled out in African countries in 2021, the first generic pediatric version of a key anti-retroviral available even for babies, aid agencies said on Tuesday, World AIDS Day.

Some 100,000 children die of AIDS annually."For many of those children, the HIV virus is not suppressed due in part to lack of availability of effective drugs that are palatable and properly adapted for them," UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel told a Geneva news briefing.UNITAID, a global health agency, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative have reached a pricing agreement with the generic drugmakers Viatris and Macleods for the dispersible pediatric formulation of dolutegravir, a statement said.The first-line HIV treatment is recommended by the World Health Organization from the age of 4 weeks and three kilograms, but it had been out of reach for babies because of the lack of appropriate formulations. The estimated cost for combination therapy will now be some $120 for a child's annual treatment, against $480 currently, making it a "game-changer" for poorer countries, UNITAID said.Newspaper headline: Generic HIV drug to be rolled out for kids in Africa
