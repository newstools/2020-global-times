The international scientific community believes that the Lancang-Mekong's cascade hydropower stations have contributed to the stability of the river flow and helping with flood control and drought relief across the region. Wang said that the facts fully reflect the achievements linked to water resource cooperation under LMC."Facts speak louder than words. China will push forward Lancang-Mekong water resource cooperation forming a key part of a six-party partnership responding to drought and flood disasters and enhancing the river region's  sustainable development," Wang added.
