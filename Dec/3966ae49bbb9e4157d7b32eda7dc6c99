The safest thing right now is to stay at home," he said.In addressing the ongoing human psychological toll of the pandemic, Kluge said "a growing mental health crisis" had been inflicted upon the European region."From anxieties around virus transmission, the psychological impact of lockdowns and self-isolation, to the effects of unemployment, financial worries, and social exclusion, the mental health impact of the pandemic will be long-term and far-reaching."Further elaborating on the devastating psychological impact, Kluge cited national surveys in the region which had revealed that a third or more of adults, one in two young people (18 to 29-year-olds) and up to 20 percent of health care workers were already subject to anxiety and depression because of the pandemic.As even larger numbers are expected to face severe mental health challenges in the coming months, Kluge made a call for action across the European region."In acknowledgment of the growing crisis, I am calling for concerted action to invest in stronger mental health care services, particularly those that bring care to the community or utilize digital care to reduce obstacles to vital assistance," he said.

When we look back at these unprecedented times, I hope we all felt we acted with a spirit of shared humanity to protect those in need."
