Organizers of the coronavirus-postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games said Wednesday they have picked a new creative director to redesign "simpler and more restrained" opening and closing ceremonies for the 2021 Games.

"It is appropriate to make ceremonial events and programs simpler and have them in some way reflect and respect the world's experience of the COVID-19 pandemic," they said.Speaking to reporters, Sasaki said he still remembered watching as a child the opening ceremony for the 1964 Olympic Games, the first time Tokyo hosted the Summer Games, and had enjoyed the traditionally lavish events opening and closing the sporting event."But now these flashy extravagant ceremonies are considered as too much and we must think of this time as an opportunity to change due to COVID-19, or rather thanks to COVID-19," he said.He conceded that he has not made much progress yet on the direction of the new ceremonies, but said they would emphasize the theme of the Games serving as the "light at the end of the tunnel" after the pandemic.
