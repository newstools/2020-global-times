"A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities."Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who also testified at the hearing, called for more fiscal stimulus to boost the virus-ravaged economy over the next few months."The risk of overdoing it is less than the risk of under doing it," Powell said, without offering detailed advice for the Congress.Mnuchin, in his testimony, urged the Congress to pass a targeted fiscal package to support the economy's recovery.The Democrats-controlled House of Representatives in early October passed a 2.2-trillion-dollar relief bill, but Senate Republicans has recently been pushing for a 500-billion-dollar package. On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced an aid proposal worth about 908 billion dollars.
