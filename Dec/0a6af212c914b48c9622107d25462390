One in four health centers worldwide lacks access to water, putting around 1.8 billion people at increased risk of contracting the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Monday.

The study was based on data from 165 countries."Working in a healthcare facility without water, sanitation and hygiene is akin to sending nurses and doctors to work without personal protective equipment," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.These elements "are fundamental to stopping COVID-19. But there are still major gaps to overcome, particularly in least developed countries."Â According to WHO figures, while health professionals make up less than 3 percent of the population, they account for 14 percent of COVID-19 cases recorded around the world."Sending healthcare workers and people in need of treatment to facilities without clean water, safe toilets or even soap puts their lives at risk," said UNICEF chief Henrietta Fore.The report also found that one in three health facilities around the world could not guarantee hand hygiene, while one in 10 did not have access to sanitation services. The figures are even worse for the world's 47 least-developed countries, where half of healthcare centers have no access to drinking water, a quarter have no access to water for hygiene purposes, and three in five lack basic sanitation services.Newspaper headline: Health center water crisis increasing virus risk
