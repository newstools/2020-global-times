On the possibility of talks continuing next year, the spokesman said: "I can rule that out."The trade negotiations are at a crucial stage as time is running out for both sides to secure a deal before the Brexit transition period expires at the end of the year.Failure to reach a free trade agreement means bilateral trade will fall back on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules in 2021.
