In the US, a $908 billion coronavirus aid plan is currently under debate in Congress.In Japan, the pandemic has forced the government to put its fiscal reform agenda on the back burner, despite holding the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden, which is twice the size of its gross domestic product."We have compiled the new measures to maintain employment, sustain business and restore the economy and open a way to achieve new growth in green and digital areas, so as to protect people's lives and livelihoods," Suga said at the meeting.Suga's cabinet is expected to set to endorse the stimulus package later on Tuesday, which would bring the combined value of coronavirus-related stimulus to about $3 trillion.Reuters
