Any attempts to incite distrust and even hatred among different nations and civilizations are extremely irresponsible. Those who are obsessed with great power rivalries already have their feet in the trap, Cui said in his address to the annual conference of the Institute of China-US Studies.Professor Allison Graham had warned about Thucydides trap but "nothing is written in stone," Cui said, noting everything depends on the choices made. "We have to have a shared vision for the future and make the right choice," Cui stressed.Chinese observers viewed Cui's address as a strong signal to the Biden team to cast aside current conflicts and meet China halfway on the cooperation path, as the two countries still have a wide range of areas in which to collaborate, including fighting against the pandemic.Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the Global Times that voices calling for cooperation before the US' power transition are China's consistent practice, but it is of special importance after the devastation of bilateral ties in the past four years. Cui's remarks were not the first time that China expressed that China and the US should cast aside their past conflicts and loggerheads to keep bilateral relations on a constructive track to benefit people from both countries as well as the global community.Chinese President Xi Jinping on November 25 sent a "well-timed" congratulatory message to Joe Biden after the White House started its transition of power process, where Xi expressed hope that China and the US "will uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focusing on cooperation and managing differences." Fu Ying, former Chinese vice foreign minister, published an article in the New York Times titled, "Cooperative Competition Is Possible Between China and the US," proposing a way forward for the world's two leading powers. China has sent goodwill on multiple occasions; therefore, it is time for Biden's team to show their sincerity for managing conflicts and resuming the relationship, analysts said. Li pointed out that dealing with his country's epidemic would be the most urgent task for Biden, without which he might fail the test of mid-term elections. It would also be an area the two major countries could cooperate on and benefit the world.China will also be a key player in the global economic recovery and climate change which are two important areas on the Democrats' agenda, Li said.Biden has vowed to curb the domestic spread of the coronavirus which has infected more than 14 million Americans so far. He also planned to bring the US back to the Paris Climate Accord as early as February, media reported.Observers believed Biden would take "milder" tactics toward China, to control conflict and cooperate in certain areas of mutual benefit. Li therefore urged for a quick resumption of damaged and halted conversation mechanisms to discuss, control conflicts and communicate on cooperation."From high-level interactions to personnel exchanges...it requires further observation on how Biden's team would act during the transition period and after taking over, but it should be done as soon as possible," Li said.
