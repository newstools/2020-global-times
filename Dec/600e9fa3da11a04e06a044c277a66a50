In one case in February off the coast of Japan, passengers were stuck for weeks aboard the Diamond Princess with over 700 guests and crew infected."A guest was feeling unwell and tested positive for COVID-19...We are asking all guests to remain in their staterooms to prevent the spread of illness," the captain of the Quantum of the Seas told passengers in a video shared on social media."We kindly ask all guests with urgent medical or health situations like diabetes, heart disease etc to contact guest services," he said.Confirming the positive test, Royal Caribbean said that all guests and crew who had close contact with the infected guest have subsequently tested negative for the virus."Emergency response plans have been activated according to guidelines including immediate isolation of close contacts, contact tracing and deep-cleaning of the ship," Annie Chang, director of the cruise segment at Singapore Tourism Board said.Reuters
