The framework capable of realizing the legitimate aspirations of both peoples is one of two states, living side-by-side in peace and security, based on the 1967 borders, and with Jerusalem as the capital of both states."On this International Day of Solidarity, let us renew our commitment to the Palestinian people in their quest to achieve their inalienable rights and build a future of peace, justice, security and dignity," said the secretary-general.
