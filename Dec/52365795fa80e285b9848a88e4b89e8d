US President Donald Trump holds up his fist as he leaves the stage at the end of a rally to support Republican Senate candidates at Valdosta Regional Airport in Valdosta, Georgia, the US on Saturday. Photo: AFPUS President Donald Trump made clear Saturday he had no intention of relinquishing his baseless claims that November's election was stolen from him, telling a raucous crowd at his first post-poll rally he would somehow still win.In a speech remarkable for its twisting of reality more than a month after the November 3 election, the outgoing president launched into another litany of allegations that the polls won handily by Democrat Joe Biden were rigged.The crowd in Valdosta, Georgia for what was nominally a rally in support of two Republican Senate candidates facing a hugely consequential runoff election roared in support, at one point chanting "fight for Trump."Even with COVID-19 cases surging nationwide, there were few masks in the crowd and many ignored social-distancing rules.In a nearly two-hour speech, Trump, 74, declared he would not concede, at times sticking to his script but regularly going off-the-cuff for his more incendiary claims."We're winning this election," Trump told the rally, down to the soaring country song "God Bless the USA" played as he took the stage with First Lady Melania Trump.It was yet another example of Trump breaking democratic norms, engaging in conspiracy-mongering and presenting falsehoods in ways unprecedented in US history.His stance has raised the question of how he will react when Biden's January 20 swearing-in date arrives."The swing states that we're all fighting over now, I won them all by a lot," Trump said, falsely."And I have to say, if I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser. If I lost, I would say, I lost, and I'd go to Florida and I'd take it easy and I'd go around and I'd say I did a good job. But you can't ever accept when they steal and rig and rob."Trump has barely left the White House since Biden was projected winner of the election on November 7.There had been concerns from some Republicans over whether Trump's continuing claims of fraud would drive down voter turnout among Republicans in the upcoming election, making his appearance in Georgia somewhat of a gamble.AFP
