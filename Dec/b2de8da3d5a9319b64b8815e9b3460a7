The Taiwan branch of the mainland's Air China and Shenzhen Airlines also had a similar announcement online.Earlier in October, the Civil Aviation Administration of China announced that passengers departing from Taiwan for the Chinese mainland should provide a negative nucleic acid test report three days (72 hours) before boarding.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, only the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority has insisted on the wrong use of COVID-19, which has intensified the antagonism and hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.The DPP authority on the island banned Taiwan suppliers from sending medical masks to the mainland at the beginning of the outbreak.Wang noted that the change was related to the White House change as US President-elect Joe Biden is more inclined to follow international norms than Donald Trump, who has publicly described COVID-19 as "China's virus." Taiwan's pro-secessionist media, politicians and pundits might not stop using the offensive term against the mainland, but the mainland will never tolerate any harmful moves against mainland and cross-Strait stability, said Wang.
