Hong Kong government holds an oath-taking ceremony for undersecretaries and political assistants on Wednesday. Witnessed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the 12 undersecretaries and 14 political assistants vowed to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and swore allegiance to the HKSAR.

It is better for HKSAR to establish a more complete legal norm regarding punishment and management of public officials," Tian Feilong, a legal expert on Hong Kong affairs at Beihang University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday. "Making huge adjustments to the existing framework of the Election Committee is a major constitutional issue within the scope of 'one country, two systems,' which needs to be dealt with carefully. Otherwise, it will have a major impact on the existing framework of democracy and constitutional governance in Hong Kong," said Tian, "This is not something the central government pursues."On November 11, the NPC Standing Committee issued a decision on the qualifications of members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo), saying that those who support Hong Kong secessionism, seek foreign interference or commit acts endangering national security, do not support the Basic Law, or are not loyal to the HKSAR will immediately lose their membership in the LegCo.Although mainly targeted at Hong Kong legislators, the decision also mentioned that the rules apply to all public officials, which means that the SAR should take the initiative to deal with district council members who violate the Basic Law, analysts said. "The central government wants to keep Hong Kong's politics pluralistic and dynamic, with legitimate and orderly competition, rather than stifling the opposition," Tian said. After the enactment of the national security law in Hong Kong, there is no urgent need for the central government to make a drastic move, Tang Fei, a Hong Kong-based member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday. What central government needs to be careful about is whether the Pan-democratic legislators seats would be a "crucial minority," in the 1,200-seat Election Committee, said Tang. "After adding 117 seats from the district council, 300 or 400 seats mean that they can largely decide the result, which would coerce all candidates."Only 51 representatives of HK's Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee members were in the electoral body, which Tang believes is not enough compared to the number of district councilors.
