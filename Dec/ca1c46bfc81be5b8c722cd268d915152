European Union leaders are likely to unblock on Thursday a stalled 1.8 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion) package to help revive the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic and agree on new, more ambitious CO2 emissions reduction goals to fight climate change.

The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, held a Leaders' Virtual Meeting on November 26.

Since Warsaw and Budapest are under EU probes for undermining the independence of courts and media, they are at risk of losing billions from the EU. But Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the 27-country bloc until the end of 2020, struck a deal with the two countries that will allow them to lift their veto. Under the deal, EU leaders will issue a declaration, stating that the rule-of-law link to funds will be applied objectively and only to safeguard the proper use of EU money, rather than to punish countries under the separate EU rule-of-law probes.The practical application of the regulation could anyway be delayed by about two years because Poland and Hungary can ask the EU's top court to decide if it is in line with EU treaties. This could push the application of the new rules past the 2022 elections in Hungary, which some EU officials said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was keen on. Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto has already declared victory and Polish President Andrzej Duda spoke of a preliminary deal. Ambassadors of EU countries gave the agreement a positive initial review, although they left the final decision to leaders on Thursday.Newspaper headline: Diplomats may agree on initial review
