A similar calculation would take 600 million years on the world’s current classical supercomputers.A quantum computer with 50 qubits is generally regarded as a key threshold for surpassing classical computers, said the People’s Daily on Friday.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
