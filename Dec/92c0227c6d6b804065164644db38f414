Sinovac will send the third batch of COVID-19 vaccine to its Brazilian partner Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo state on Sunday evening for local mass vaccination scheduled in January. The Global Times saw that the Chinese inactivated vaccine candidate called CoronaVac goes through a complex packaging process - from vaccine bulk grouting to finished-product packaging - before being shipped around the world.The vaccine packs are stored at 2C to 8C. But thermal stability tests have shown the vaccine can be effective for more than one month at 25C and more than 20 days at 37C.The entire production chain uses advanced digital technology to strictly monitor each and every step, with manual double-checks at every step.The vaccine pulp developed from the inactivated virus is encapsulated either in vials or separate needles. The latter is preferred due to its simpler operation, shorter procedure, and better conservation of vaccine pulp. Needles and syringe bottles used for injections have to be sterile and disposable.Drug regulators from several countries, including Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency, have visited the company's workshops to inspect its protocols and technology before giving official approval of the vaccine registration in their own countries.
