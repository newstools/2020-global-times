And we now know nothing, not even a pandemic or an abuse of power can extinguish that," Biden said."Our democracy - pushed, tested, threatened - proved to be resilient, true, and strong."Biden said that Trump has had full opportunity to contest the results in court and "in ­every case no cause or evidence was found to reverse or question or dispute."With the Electoral College having formalized his victory just hours earlier, Biden told the bitterly divided country, "It's time to turn the page.""I'm convinced we can work together for the good of the ­nation," he said.Trump continues to maintain that he was cheated of victory, even if his lawyers have not persuaded one court that they have a case.On Monday he announced that Attorney General Bill Barr, who contradicted his fraud claims, would leave his post next week.The Electoral College vote, a formality confirming the will of voters expressed at the polls, is usually ignored by all but hard-core politics buffs.This year, the somewhat arcane procedure took center stage as the US election system withstood weeks of assaults from the powerful president and much of his party.Biden only needed 270 of the 538 Electoral College votes, which are divided up among the 50 states and he was headed for a total of 306 against Trump's 232. Counting was underway all day and when it got to California, the Democrat went over the minimum amount, making him officially the president-elect from that point on.California's electors burst into applause as the presiding officer read out the tally.Biden, Barack Obama's former vice president, will be sworn in as the 46th president on January 20.
