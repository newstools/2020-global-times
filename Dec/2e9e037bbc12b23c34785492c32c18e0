China's grain output reached nearly 670 billion kg in 2020, up 5.65 billion kg, or 0.9 percent, from last year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday.

The yield for soybeans has not improved in the past 20 years, resulting in large grain imports, he said.Â China imported 4.79 million tons of corns in 2019, a year-on-year increase of 36 percent, data from Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs showed.
