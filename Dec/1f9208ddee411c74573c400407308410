In East Asian countries such as China and South Korea the popularity of traditional public bathhouses gradually formed a particular bathhouse culture that includes chatting, pedicure services and massages. Overshadowed by more expensive and modern entertainment complexes, these bathhouses that used to dominate  North China's cities and towns have been disappearing. According to the director, the comedy about friendship and family ties seeks to warm audiences as well as bring the fun since "it was a tough 2020 ruined by the COVID-19 epidemic."
