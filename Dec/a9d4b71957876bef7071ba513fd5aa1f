I spend at least six hours on social media like Sina Weibo and Douyin every day," netizen "beitong" commented.The survey drove more surveys and reflections on how long Chinese netizens devote to social media platforms.Some netizens said they regretted spending so much time on related apps and noted that they will try to change their habits and take more time to talk with families or read.Japanese and German netizens spend the least amount of time of 46 minutes and one hour and 20 minutes respectively.The report analyzed that some of the more developed markets such as Japan and Germany have shown signs of plateauing, which could be driven by aging populations in these countries.
