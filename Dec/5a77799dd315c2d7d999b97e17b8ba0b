Hua Chunying File photo:CGTNChina firmly opposes US actions to politicize securities regulation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Wednesday, when asked about a bill proposed by US Congress that could force Chinese companies to forego their listings on American stock exchanges. The move once again showed that the US is taking a discriminatory approach, waging a political crackdown on Chinese companies, spokesperson Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing in Beijing.In today's highly globalized capital market, strengthening cross-border regulatory cooperation using open and honest means is the most effective way to enhance cooperation on issues such as protecting the investors' rights."We oppose the US move to politicize securities regulation and hope the US will strive to provide a fair and stable environment for foreign companies investing and operating in the US, rather than trying to impose unnecessary hurdles," Hua said.
