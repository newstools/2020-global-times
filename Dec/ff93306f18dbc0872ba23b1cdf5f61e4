Controversy arose online after 24 households in Huanggang, Central China's Hubei Province, were each fined 200 yuan ($30.5) for buying imported cold-chain pork online. The pork was recognized as problematic after a sample from the same batch tested positive for COVID-19.  Those who agreed with the punishment believed that individual customers should be more cautious as more and more imported cold-chain food products and their outer packaging have found traces of COVID-19. However, others remained skeptical about the punishment. It is unknown when these consumers bought the problematic pork and if the online ordering and delivery platform they used, Meituan, which is now being investigated by police, received the required permission or food safety certificate before putting the pork onto their shelves. The positive test result of the same batch of imported pork was reported earlier on Tuesday to the health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, and a total of 86 samples from people and 122 samples from the environment were collected and tested within 48 hours. The environment has also been thoroughly disinfected, according to a statement from the Huangzhou district of Huanggang city.The 24 households are now required to undergo self-paid nucleic acid tests and remain in homes for quarantine purposes. Local authorities in Huangzhou district of Huanggang city — where the residents live — have banned all purchases, storage and sales of imported cold-chain products since October 28. Many netizens on Sina Weibo, however, expressed that they believed, in this case, the consumers are innocent and also victims to some extent. In fact, it is the platform Meituan that needs to be thoroughly investigated. "The normal circulation of goods is protected by law. If the purchase of a certain kind of goods is prohibited, the management of the case should begin with the seller," said a Weibo user.Some netizens also pointed out that the punishment basis claimed by the local government, "Regulations on Public Security Administration and Punishment," was abolished on March 1, 2006, with the implementation of the "Law on Public Security Administration and Punishment." The wrong use of the name of the law also made some netizens consider whether the government acted irresponsibly in handling the incident.Zhi Zhenfeng, a legal expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times that as long as consumers buy imported pork products through legal channels, there is no legal reason to punish them, suggesting that fining the 24 households was unnecessary. Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times that the move from Huangzhou district is understandable, as preventing the resurgence of the epidemic is a top priority of the local government, reflecting the government's awareness of prevention measures.Yang said the risks of buying imported cold-chain food products from online and offline sources are almost the same, as they all related to the uncertainty of exporting countries' prevention measures.Zhu Danpeng, a veteran of the food industry, told the Global Times that cold-chain imports may pose the greatest risk to additional COVID-19 outbreaks this winter. "It is vital to reduce imports, but, more importantly, stricter measures will have to be implemented on thorough sampling and inspections."Some netizens also worried that their local governments would follow the example set by the Huangzhou district; that is, banning the purchase of imported cold-chain meats and seafood, leading to higher prices.East China's Hefei in Anhui Province announced on Monday that imported cold-chain food products that fails to provide a certificate of safety shall not be allowed to be sold in markets, and consumers shall register using their real names when buying imported cold-chain food.A government official from Huanggang reached by the Global Times on Friday said that residents' lives have not been greatly affected, and confirmed the current policy requirements are limited only to the Huangzhou district.Given China's huge food consumption, it would be unrealistic to stop pork imports altogether, said Yang, noting that the order of consumer consideration should be domestic fresh pork, imported frozen pork from offline sources, and online purchases. He suggested that people should check the relevant imported food inspection and quarantine reports; disinfect food products' external packaging and kitchenware and do not eat raw products.More than 40 cases related to imported cold-chain food products have been reported in at least 16 provinces and regions, leading to local infections in North China's Tianjin and East China's Qingdao.
