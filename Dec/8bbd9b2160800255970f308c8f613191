Washington once labeled Khartoum a hub of the "axis of evil," but relations between the US and Sudan have warmed since ex-president Omar al-Bashir was ousted last year.The US on Monday formally removed Sudan's state sponsor of terrorism designation, 27 years after putting the country on its blacklist, the US Embassy in Khartoum announced.Â In 1993, the US put Sudan on its blacklist of countries it accuses of supporting terrorism."The congressional notification period of 45 days has lapsed and the Secretary of State has signed a notification stating rescission of Sudan's State Sponsor of Terrorism designation is effective as of today, to be published in the Federal Register," the US Embassy said on Facebook.President Donald Trump announced in October that he was delisting Sudan, a step desperately sought by the nation's new civilian-backed government as the designation severely impeded foreign investment.As part of a deal, Sudan agreed to pay $335 million to compensate survivors and victims' families from the twin 1998 attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, carried out when Bashir was welcoming Al Qaeda, and a 2000 attack on the USS Cole off Yemen's coast.Sudan's transitional government, which took over last year, also agreed to recognize Israel, a major goal for Trump, although Khartoum has sought to downplay the connection.Trump sent his notice to Congress on October 26 and, under US law, a country exits the terror list after 45 days unless Congress objects, which it has not.
