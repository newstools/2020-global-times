Lujiazui Photo:VCGTop Chinese policymakers on Friday put heavy emphasis on addressing various internal challenges ranging from consumption, technology and financial security at a key meeting that outlines top policy priorities for 2021, signaling the world's second-largest economy is shifting reliance on the domestic economy as external risks continue to mount marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and trade tensions.At the closely watched Central Economic Work Conference, attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials, top leaders commended "historic" achievements in the battle against the COVID-19 epidemic, while concluding the Chinese economy continues to face many uncertainties from the external environment, not-so-solid recovery conditions and various risks posed by the pandemic.The focus on strengthening the domestic economy and indigenous technological innovation is the answer to internal and external challenges, and the recent steady recovery in the Chinese economy and promising prospects for growth in 2021 offered sufficient room for policymakers to address these challenges to ensure long-term high-quality growth, analysts said.

This year's meeting has greater significance, as 2021 will mark a critical inflection point for the Chinese economy, when China seeks to further consolidate its steady recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, start the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) and embark on its next centennial goal of building a modern socialist power.

Under that overarching theme, the meeting outlined efforts in eight areas of priorities.Among the areas are efforts to bolster the country's strategic technology capability to address major challenges that hamstring the country's development and security. Despite an escalating technological war launched by the US, the meeting called for international cooperation in technological research and development.

Also related to ensuring an independent supply chain, the meeting called for efforts to address issues regarding seeds and land to ensure steady food supply. In line with the overall focus on the domestic market, the meeting also called for a series of efforts, including job creation and improvements to the social security net, to expand domestic demand."The most important theme could be the Chinese government's focus on reforms on the demand side in the next five years" to boost domestic demand, Wei Jianguo, former Chinese vice minister of commerce and executive deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told the Global Times, adding that bolstering the internal economy would help address domestic and foreign risks. "As the pandemic revealed, China's reliance on the world is decreasing, while the world's reliance on China is increasing. So we have to further build on that and significantly boost our domestic economy to cope with any potential risks," Wei said.Part of the priority to root out domestic risks, the meeting also stressed the need to strengthen anti-trust regulations to prevent "disorderly expansion of capital," signaling tightening regulations for the financial technology sector.

In line with recent adjustments, the meeting did not offer any indication of a specific target next year by only calling for striving to maintain economic operations at "reasonable range.""I don't think there will be any mention of a specific growth target this year. Rather, it will stick to stabilizing six areas," Li Chang'an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics' School of Public Administration, told the Global Times, referring to officials' stated goals of stabilizing the jobs market, financial market, trade, foreign capital, investment and expectations. "Without a specific target, there would be more focus on coordinating policies and addressing other long-term issues."Still, analysts said that major efforts could be put in place to ensure relatively high-speed growth in 2021 to start the first year of the 14th Five-Year Plan on strong footing. Coming on the heels of what officials call a "strategic victory" over the virus and steady recovery, the Chinese economy is expected to grow at around 2 percent in 2020 and about 8 percent in 2021, taking the global lead, according to various projections.That would also offer Chinese policymakers sufficient room to make major policy shifts to address risks to the domestic economy, analysts noted.

"The leverage ratio has increased so fast that it poses a huge risk," Tian told the Global Times, noting that the leverage ratio has reached the level in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009. "So, deleveraging will be a priority for next year's economic work."Another sign of China's determination to address long-term challenges, the meeting also called for better efforts to ensure China reach its goal of peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. Housing, which has been a focus in recent years' meetings, also remained one of the top priorities, as top officials signaled a continued crackdown on speculation in the real estate market."Overall, 2021 will be a tough year with a combination of old and new challenges. The most important goal is to consolidate the success in the recovery from the COVID-19, while taking structural reforms to address long-term issues," Tian said.Newspaper headline: China sets 2021 economy priorities
