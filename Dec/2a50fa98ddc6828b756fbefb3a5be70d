Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi File photo: XinhuaChina and the US should launch dialogues at all levels, as all issues can be brought to the table for discussion, whether they are strategic, comprehensive and long-term tasks or specific ones, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a video conference with the US-China Business Council board of chairs on Monday. The Chinese official said that China's door for dialogue is open anytime, and the two countries can work together to formulate three lists on dialogue, communication and dispute management, which will provide a clear roadmap for maintaining and developing bilateral ties. The fundamental reason why the China-US relationship has faced its most severe situation since the official establishment of diplomatic ties is that some people in the US adhere to an outdated Cold War mentality and ideological bias by seeing China's development and China-US relations from a zero-sum game perspective while regarding China as an opponent or even an enemy, Wang noted. He emphasized that the fundamental goal of China's development is to give Chinese people better lives, which can be achieved by cooperating with others. Given such a goal, we hope and believe that the US' China-related policy will sooner or later return to objectivity and rationality, Wang said, claiming that strategic researchers, business and industry representatives are all encouraged to enhance dialogue and communication, pushing forward bilateral ties. The Chinese Foreign Minister made five suggestions on China-US ties, including correcting the strategic recognition of the bilateral relationship, enhancing dialogue and communication, expanding mutual benefits and cooperation, managing divergences while avoiding ideological confrontation as well as improving public opinion.  The most urgent task now is to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and China is willing to continue providing assistance to the US by sharing its anti-epidemic experience and providing medical supplies, and working on vaccine and medical development, Wang said. He also emphasized that trade and business cooperation still serves as the "fundamental propeller" for bilateral ties, within which American businesses should play an active role in stabilizing a healthy relationship. China and the US should support and encourage each other's legislative bodies, localities, business communities, think tanks, academies, media, and youth to strengthen friendly exchanges, deepen mutual understanding, and lay a solid foundation of public opinion for bilateral relations, Wang said, noting that it should also eliminate the soil for the spread of lies and false information.
