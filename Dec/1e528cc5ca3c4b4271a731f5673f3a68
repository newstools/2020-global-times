After getting feedback from the public, the issue was re-examined, and in consultation with cabinet colleagues and senior officials, the decision has been withdrawn," a statement from the chief minister's office said.The withdrawal comes within 24-hours of its announcement made on Wednesday to impose eight-hour night curfew across the state till Jan. 2 and shortly after state police issued SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for the curfew period.Karnataka, with 13,755 active cases with 12,038 deaths reported so far, was to be the second Indian state to enforce night curfew after the western state of Maharashtra.
