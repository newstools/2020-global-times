Johnson has warned that there is a "strong possibility" that Britain and the EU will fail to strike a post-Brexit trade agreement.The two leaders have had phone conversations several times instead of face-to-face discussions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.To bring life back to normal, countries including Britain, China, Germany, Russia, and the United States are racing against time to find a vaccine.Britain and the EU started their lengthy and bumpy post-Brexit talks in March after Britain ended its EU membership on Jan. 31, 2020, trying to secure a future trade deal before the Brexit transition period expires.The trade negotiations are at a crucial stage as time is running out for both sides to secure a deal before the Brexit transition period expires at the end of the year.Failure to reach a free trade agreement means bilateral trade will fall back on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules in 2021.
