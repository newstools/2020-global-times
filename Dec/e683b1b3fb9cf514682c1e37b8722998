People in the medium-risk area have been asked in principle not to leave the capital and those who have to leave Beijing need to carry a negative nucleic acid test result valid for seven days. Beijing has started nucleic acid tests of residents and the environment in the area, as well as those in the surrounding neighborhood.Ding Sheng, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said at the press conference that the city launched a general inspection of COVID-19 prevention and control work at housing construction sites and infrastructure projects in the city. If any major risks and management loopholes are found in the inspection, the construction sites and infrastructure projects shall be ordered to stop work and rectify these issues.According to the press conference, a local performance that had a larger audience than the approved number has been investigated.In addition, a spokesperson for the Beijing local government said that it discourages citizens from traveling abroad or to domestic areas that are classified as medium or high risk.Global Times
