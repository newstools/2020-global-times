Ou QingpingTo date, 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties in China have been lifted out of poverty, and by the end of year, all impoverished people will have shaken off poverty, the State Council Information Office said Wednesday, adding that the new round of poverty alleviation monitoring work will make full use of big data analysis to make sure these families won't slip back into poverty easily.The poverty alleviation monitoring will take family as a serving unit, and mainly cover the poor households that have been lifted out of poverty but are unstable, and marginal households whose income is slightly higher than the poverty line.One-to-one dynamic monitoring was carried out in March by the local governments of poor and marginal households at risk of returning to poverty due to the COVID-19 epidemic or natural disasters. Once such a family was found, their details were recorded and they were given assistance.Zeng Ping, deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China's Xinyu city committee, explained on Wednesday that relying on the unified information-sharing platform and big data center in Xinyu city, a household economic status verification system covering all fields and departments in the city as well as all counties, districts and towns has been developed.For example, regular comparisons by the relevant departments can accurately check the information of families that can easily slip back into poverty and decide whether they are qualified to receive support.For households lifted out of poverty, the poverty alleviation departments in education, health care, medical insurance and housing construction sectors will make regular checks of the implementation of the policy to ensure rural poor people are free from worries over food and clothing and have access to compulsory education, basic medical services and safe housing, and screen their risk of returning to poverty.China has 10 million relocated poor people and 5 million of their family members accompanying them, Ou Qingping, deputy director of the Poverty Alleviation Office of the State Council explained on Wednesday. Follow-up assistance work for these people requires financial support and resource investment. At the same time, local governments will strengthen the management and supervision of funds and assets for poverty alleviation projects.
