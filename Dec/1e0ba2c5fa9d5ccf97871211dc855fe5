Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi Photo:Ministry of Foreign AffairsChina and the US are likely to prioritize trade and business dialogues, while diplomatic dialogues could reopen after Joe Biden takes office in January, meanwhile it would be a slow process for the two countries' return to cooperation. Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday that the trade, business, culture and education sectors, which are not political fields, are likely to be the "first window" for the countries to launch dialogues amid the change of  the US leadership.Li's remarks came after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged both countries to open dialogues at all levels on Monday.Li predicted that after dialogues and cooperation in non-political fields break the ice between China and the US, the two countries would eye dialogues in politics and national security.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a video conference with the US-China Business Council board of chairs on Monday that the two countries should launch dialogues at all levels, as all issues can be brought to the table for discussion, whether they are strategic, comprehensive and long-term tasks or specific ones.Wang said that China's door for dialogues is open anytime, and the two countries can work together to formulate three lists on dialogue, communication and dispute management, which will provide a clear roadmap for maintaining and developing bilateral ties. The Trump administration is not likely to withdraw its attempt to decouple with China, and the diplomatic stalemate would only deteriorate, Li said.China should seek communication with Biden's team to lay the foundation for bilateral official dialogues and cooperation in diplomacy and other fields after Biden takes office next January, he added.After the Biden administration takes power, the US will strengthen cooperation with China in economic recovery, and tackle climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, but continue its policy over China's Hong Kong issues and Taiwan question, said Li.Dialogue and cooperation are not easy and will be a slow process, as the US domestic political climate has been poisoned. Although Biden's team is more rational, there would be  big change in US' China policy, Li warned.Wang noted at the video conference that a fundamental reason why the China-US relationship has faced its most severe situation since the official establishment of diplomatic ties is that some people in the US adhere to an outdated Cold War mentality and ideological bias by seeing China's development and China-US relations from a zero-sum game perspective while regarding China as an opponent or even an enemy. The most urgent task is to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and China is willing to continue providing assistance to the US by sharing its anti-epidemic experiences and providing medical supplies, and working on vaccines and medical development, Wang said. He also emphasized that trade and business cooperation still serves as the "fundamental propeller" for bilateral ties, within which US businesses should play an active role in stabilizing a healthy relationship.
