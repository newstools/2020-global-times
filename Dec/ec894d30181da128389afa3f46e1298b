These include medical, health and epidemic prevention personnel, port quarantine and border inspection personnel, civil service staff, and people who are going abroad on business. China began emergency vaccinations against COVID-19 in July, and has completed more than 1 million doses of the vaccine so far, with no serious adverse reactions, government officials said at a press conference held by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council on December 19. With the conditional or officially approved vaccine marketing and the increase of vaccine production, China's vaccination project will be carried out in a comprehensive and orderly manner for high-risk groups such as the elderly and the general population, officials said. China recorded 14 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, including seven imported cases. There are 11 middle-risk regions in the Chinese mainland as of Friday afternoon.Global Times
