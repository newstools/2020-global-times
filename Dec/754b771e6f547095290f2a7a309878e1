Four months after his death shocked the world, trailblazing US actor Chadwick Boseman makes his heartbreaking, hotly Oscar-tipped final film appearance in 1920s blues drama Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.

On December 10, Disney paid tribute to Boseman by announcing that his iconic role as T'Challa will not be recast in the sequel. In his final film, Boseman's cornet player Levee has been hired to support Ma Rainey, who has traveled from the Deep South to record her hit songs on a sweltering summer afternoon in a back-alley studio.As diva-esque Ma Rainey battles duplicitous producers who want to cash in on her voice and send her packing, Levee plots his own path to solo musical glory while revealing a childhood ravaged by white brutality.In a bravura performance, Boseman delivers searing monologues that vow to "make the white man respect me" and curse a God who "hates your black ass" - interspersed with moments of impish charisma, foot-shuffling dance moves and outrageous flirting.Ma Rainey is the second of Pulitzer Prize-winning Wilson's 10-play "Pittsburgh Cycle" to be adapted by producer Denzel Washington, with each chronicling the African-American experience in a different 20th-century decade.In a quirk of fate, Washington once funded the studies of a group of young black US actors attending a prestigious British summer drama program - including a then-unknown Boseman."I'm happy that I got to be a part of sharing his genius with the world," said Washington in the film's production notes."I miss him and I love him. On film we'll always have him and I'll never forget him."For Boseman, that course in Oxford was a seminal opportunity to study Shakespeare, Beckett and Pinter - but also fostered a desire to propel the works of black playwrights into the same canon."I always felt like black writers were just as classical," he once told Rolling Stone. "It's just as difficult to do August Wilson, and the stories he's telling are just as epic."Davis and director George C. Wolfe have little doubt over Boseman's credentials to become the third posthumous acting Oscar winner, after Heath Ledger (2008's The Dark Knight) and Peter Finch (1976's Network.)"Chadwick put his entire being into Levee... Levee demands that because of the Herculean scale of the role," said Wolfe. "He put every ounce of his heart and passion into it."Newspaper headline: Heartbreaking swan song
