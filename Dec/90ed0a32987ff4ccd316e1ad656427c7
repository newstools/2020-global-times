"The launch is a major test, in that the vehicle had to rely entirely on automatic maneuvers without any ground command."Wang explained to the Global Times that the launch from the moon could not afford any time delay. "If the probe receives a command from the Earth to help it control the separation, altitude and speed, there will be at least one second delay, which will put the process in great danger."

It means that the probe must ensure its own altitude is precise enough to enter the designated orbit through automatic decision-making, according to a statement sent to the Global Times from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC.)Chinese researchers have conducted numerous ground simulations to verify the takeoff, but the particularities of the lunar environment have made the verifications difficult, the CASC said. The rendezvous and docking, if successful, could be of great value to other deep-space or even manned missions in the future, the significance of which would be no less than the Apollo mission, once the name card of human lunar exploration activities during the Cold War, Chinese analysts said."It will be a milestone for China's aerospace development," Song Zhongping, an aerospace expert and TV commentator, said, calling it "a foresighted practice that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space explorations."It will also verify the viability of manned lunar landing missions, and even the construction of a lunar research base, or Mars missions, he told the Global Times.

The re-entry capsule will then carry the lunar sample and bring them to a designated site in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region by mid-December.

Chinese space technological development has allowed it to take a step forward in the Chang'e-5 mission, the third consecutive safe soft landing on the moon in seven years. The Chang'e-5 flag presentation system was developed by China Space Sanjiang Group under the State-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, better known as the CASIC.To ensure a complete and smooth unfolding of the flag, the system adopted a secondary rod-type structure, which is applied in solar panel extending for satellites and other types of spacecraft, CASIC developers told the Global Times on Thursday.

The system weight has been controlled at around one kilogram, and all connecting parts of the system have been given special protection, such as coldness-resistance measures, to help overcome unfavorable lunar surface conditions, including a drastic temperature difference on the moon ranging from 150 C to minus 150 C, Li Yunfeng, the project leader, said in a statement the CASIC company sent to the Global Times."An ordinary national flag on Earth would not survive the severe lunar environment," so the research team also spent more than a year selecting the proper materials to make sure the eventual flag would be strong enough, survive under extreme coldness and heat and capable of showing the fine colors of the national flag and remain so forever, said Cheng Chang, another leading member of the developer team.The national flag, 2,000 millimeters wide and 900 millimeter tall, represents cutting-edge technology, they said.How to preserve its original color and shape are the two most crucial questions in designing a national flag that must survive more than 380,000 kilometers away from Earth, under extreme temperatures and radiation during its journey, Wang Ya'nan told the Global Times. To get a sense of how difficult the task it is, five of the six flags (except for the one Apollo 11 placed on the moon) brought to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s during six US crewed moon landings, have been bleached white due to decades-long solar radiation, although they are reportedly still standing and casting shadows.Many reports say the Apollo 11 flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during lift-off.The Soviet Union was the first country to imprint its national symbol on the moon, with a football-sized metal ball, carved with its national flag, full of explosives, smashing to the lunar ground in the Luna 2 mission in 1959.Compared to such a method, China has a more advanced approach, which also greatly increased the complexity of the design, Wang noted.

"But China is about to showcase our own national flag as well, which I believe is a recognition of the achievements and breakthroughs that we have made, which will be the most valuable thing."Some readers have left comments under images and video of the Chang'e-5 landing published on the Global Times twitter account in recent days, saying they would not be convinced and acknowledge China's achievements until the lander takes an actual photo of the American flag planted by the previous Apollo mission. "Is it an original video, or a TikTok post taken in the Gobi desert," one Twitter user wrote. "Where is the lunar dust while landing," another asked.The landing was closely followed by space agencies from all over the world, and the European Space Agency, Russia's Roscosmos and NASA scientists have extended their congratulations.Pang Zhihao, a senior space expert based in Beijing, said "the lander vehicle of Chang'e-5 was designed to turn off its engine about two meters above the surface to deliberately avoid blowing dirt."And for the sake of innovation, the lander touched down on an unvisited region, which explains why there were no US craft nearby, Pang said.
