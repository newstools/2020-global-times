Paid beaches in Athens reopened on Saturday.Tourism is a major economic engine for Greece and has been hit hard by confinement measures in place to stem the spread of the virus. Greece and another nine EU states including Germany on Monday said they were in favor of "progressive" cross-border movement, "provided current positive trends continue leading to comparable epidemiological situations in countries of origin and of destination.""We call on tourism businesses and related private actors to use the coming weeks to take appropriate precautionary measures to protect travelers once freedom of movement and traveling is restored," the foreign ministries of Bulgaria, Cyprus, Spain, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia said in a joint statement.The foreign ministers who held a video conference to discuss a coordinated approach towards restoring freedom of movement, said there had to be "a common understanding of health-related standards and procedures."The Greek government on Monday said it would announce its travel and health protocols within days, but that the country was "starting from scratch" as far as season expectations are concerned."Anything we gain will be a success," said government spokesman Stelios Petsas. Newspaper headline: 'Starting from scratch'
