Hong Kong Police Wanchai district headquarters, Aug. 21, 2019 Photo:XinhuaChina’s Ministry of Public Security vowed to fully instruct and support the Hong Kong Police Force in ending riots and violence while severely cracking down on penetration of subversive and disruptive sabotage by hostile forces and resolutely safeguarding national political security.Zhao Kezhi, State Councilor and Minister of Public Security, said in a meeting following the closing of the third session of the 13th National People’s Congress that the country’s public security authority will fully study and implement the decision on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to safeguard national security, which was passed at the closing meeting Thursday, according to a statement published on the ministry’s website. The country has taken the first crucial step regarding the national security legislation for Hong Kong as the decision was passed by majority of votes, and experts noted that the next step will be finalizing the legislation in detail and making the law executable in the city within its common law legal system. The law will directly strike against the US-controlled proxies and political groups in Hong Kong, who had previously incited trouble in the city with little concern about consequences.The passage of the decision would be followed by an acceleration of formulating the law, which is expected to take effect in Hong Kong through the Annex III of the Basic Law. While the state-level national security departments are expected to establish special agencies in the SAR, and both central-level and local-level law enforcement mechanisms are expected to be enhanced in tackling acts and activities endangering national security, observers said.The ministry showed its supportive stance for the upcoming law for Hong Kong after the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison declared on Tuesday that the troops have the determination, confidence and capability to safeguard national sovereignty, security, development interests and long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. Zhao met with Tang Ping-keung, commissioner of police of the Hong Kong SAR, in December 2019 in Beijing, expressed strong support for Hong Kong police in ending chaos and riots across the city since mid-June last year. The minister also expected the local police force to resolutely protect Hong Kong's rule of law and social order. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
