The problem has also been in a thorn in the side of the 18,000 matchmaking agencies in the country. After the proposal was posted online, many Chinese netizens hailed it as a timely piece of help to them, and hoped the country would put it on the agenda. The Communist Youth League Central Committee can also take the lead in offering communication platforms or online and offline dating parties for unmarried singles, helping them find love, Tan said.Offering dating services was written into China's Middle- and Long-term Youth Development Plan (2016-25), and unveiled in 2017, setting a general goal of establishing a "youth development policy system and work mechanism" by 2020 and improving the system by 2025.The plan requires official organizations such as the All-China Women's Federation and the Communist Youth League to get involved in dating services for young Chinese.  According to data released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in January 2020, national marriage registration departments in 2019 handled a total of 9,471,000 marriage registrations. Since 2014, marriage registrations have seen a continuous decline, with the annual marriage registration falling below 10 million for the first time. Meanwhile, divorce registrations have continued to rise for more than 10 consecutive years, with the number currently standing at 4,154,000, according to data.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
