(Xinhua/Wu Xiaochu)Â The number of Hong Kong residents signing a petition in support of the national security legislation has surpassed 1.1 million as of Tuesday evening. The petition activity was launched on Sunday by a newly established organization jointly initiated by thousands of people and hundreds of groups representing various sectors in the Hong Kong community. Over the past three days, 2,005 street stands have been set up across Hong Kong and collected over 730,000 public signatures, according to the organizer - United Front Supporting National Security Legislation. In addition, more than 400,000 Hong Kong residents have taken part in the petition online. After a draft decision on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to safeguard national security was submitted to the third session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation, many Hong Kong residents have voiced support for the legislation. The spokesperson of the organization called on more Hong Kong residents to participate in the petition, which will continue until May 31, so as to express support for plugging loopholes in national security system, safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and ensuring the sustained success of "one country, two systems."
