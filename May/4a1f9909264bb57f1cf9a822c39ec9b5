Within two months, 70 institutions had added testing capabilities necessary to conduct 51,000 tests daily, Lei said.Recently, the highest number of tests completed in one day is 30,000, indicating ample reserve capacity. However, the ability of Beijing laboratories to target infectious diseases needs to be explored and improved in the long term, according to Lei.
