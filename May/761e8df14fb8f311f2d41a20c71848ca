Year-round hotels are to resume operations on June 1, followed by seasonal hotels on June 15. Flights into Athens will restart on June 15, and to the rest of Greece's regional and island airports on July 1.The EU has said holidaymakers could be asked to wear face masks on planes, respect social distancing on the beach and even book slots to use hotel pools.Greece had initially wanted incoming tourists to submit to tests at least 72 hours before travel, but Brussels frowned at the suggestion. Athens now says it will not require travelers to undergo virus testing or quarantine, but sample tests will be carried out for epidemiological purposes.Restaurants were shuttered on March 14, two days after Greece recorded its first COVID-19 death, with only takeout food and delivery allowed.Elsewhere throughout Europe, the terraces of cafes and restaurants were also reopening for the first time in months. In Madrid and Barcelona, the Spanish cities hardest hit by the virus, they finally opened, two weeks behind the rest of the country.They were also opening in the German state of Bavaria. But here too, owners complained that restrictive safe distances cut their customer numbers and thus their bottom line.Newspaper headline: Uncertain future
