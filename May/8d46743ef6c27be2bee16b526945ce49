People lay flowers to pay tribute to revolutionary martyrs during a campaign at the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing, capital of China, April 4, 2019. China has kicked off a campaign to promote paying tribute to revolutionary martyrs as Tomb-sweeping Day draws near. The campaign is aimed at combining educational activities with paying tribute. Tomb-sweeping Day, also known as Qingming Festival, falls on April 5 this year. It is a traditional Chinese holiday where people pay tribute to deceased family and friends.

The report on Friday quoted unnamed sources as saying that the Hong Kong education bureau was aware of the exam's content before the test began, with a headline pointing out that the incident aimed to "set up a trap to frame others."The bureau expressed deep regret over the report, as it had seriously undermined its integrity, read the announcement.The bureau noted that "even if a staff member was invited to serve as a member of a committee, they have to abide by strict confidentiality rules and must not disclose the content of examination questions to others, including those in the bureau."The bureau also urged all sectors to not to be deliberately misled or have their attention diverted from the real issue at hand.On Thursday night, the bureau slammed the biased question and urged the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) to follow up and rectify the issue. The bureau said that the question seriously hurt the feelings and dignity of people who suffered greatly during Japan's aggression. Deputy-director of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers Nicholas Muk also condemned the question for being extremely biased. "If the question intends to guide the students to answer with agreement, it is actually guiding the students to become hanjian (traitors to China)."Global Times
