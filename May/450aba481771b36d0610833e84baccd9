The “one country, two systems” principle can embark on a course of smooth and far-reaching sail, Ma added.The DPP authorities and some politicians on the island have repeatedly distorted the facts, conflated black with white, and arbitrarily criticized the legislation as the law will cut the backhands of Taiwan and Hong Kong secessionists and their conspiracy ties, Ma said. The so-called declaration and rescue of rioters in Hong Kong by the Taiwan legislature is a blatant refuge to illegal and violent terrorist forces, Ma said.It further exposed the political nature of their incitement to attack the “one country, two systems” principle by creating trouble in Hong Kong in a bid to seek “Taiwan independence,” Ma said, noting such plot will not succeed and the DPP authorities will bear the consequences. Global Times
