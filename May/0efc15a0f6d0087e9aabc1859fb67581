However, Ma posted a video on thepaper the day after the match in which he claimed that he could have broken Wang's nose, although some of his critics expressed their disappointment in the result."I was such a big fan of Chinese kungfu that I even waned a shifu just like the turtle in the Kungfu Panda movies," said one netizen. "But now I know that kungfu's beautiful body moves with extra-powerful fighting can only be seen in the movies or novels.""My friends and I watch professional wrestling, such as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), much more than modern Chinese martial arts competitions because we only care if you can knock out your rivals," said another.However, there were also netizens who questioned whether the match shown in the video was real, or if it was a planned one to make Chinese traditional Kungfu look bad.In responding to this, Wang's club - Shandong Jinding Zhida martial arts fitness club - made an announcement saying that it is not a governmental organization and didn't plan the video or receive any money from anyone, thepaper reported on Tuesday.The club also noted that Wang will not accept any media interviews or combat invitations."The reason why Chinese martial arts did not become an Olympic sport like Japan's judo and South Korea's Taekwondo did is because there are too many schools and there is no unified standard," said Zhao."Chinese martial arts must be in line with international standards, focus on actual combat and adopt the advantages of various martial arts if it wants kungfu to move forward and win back its glory," Zhao noted.
