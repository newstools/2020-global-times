People ride bicycles past the Colosseum in central Rome, Italy on Tuesday as the country eases its lockdown after more than two months, aimed at curbing the spread of the COVID-19 infection.

But most states have begun easing their lockdowns and many on Saturday reopened public beaches.As Europe and the US took clear steps toward reopening, Latin America emerged as a new viral hot spot. "In a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease," WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said, singling out Brazil.Many deaths in Brazil have been among younger people, who are often driven by poverty to work despite the threat of infection.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump has played down the severity of the pandemic, has faced increasing pressure amid a rising death toll, with two of his health ministers resigning within weeks.Neighboring Peru was also struggling. The country of 32 million has registered more than 3,100 deaths. Ecuador, however, has seen nearly that many deaths - 3,096 - in a country of just 17 million. Tourism Minister Rosi Prado told AFP the pandemic could cost the country's vital tourism sector $400 million a month.The outlook was also brightening elsewhere in Europe, particularly in hard-hit tourist hubs.Italy is due to reopen its borders to foreign tourists from June 3.AFP
