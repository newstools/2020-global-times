(Xinhua/Li Muzi)Â The Cuban government declared on Saturday its full support of the World Health Organization (WHO) after the United States announced it is terminating its relationship with the global organization. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez wrote on his Twitter account that Cuba lends "its full support" to the WHO and its management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rodriguez said that the decision of the United States to end its relationship with the multilateral organization "reflects the growing isolation" of Washington, adding that the decision is "contrary to multilateralism and undermines international efforts to guarantee health and save lives." US President Donald Trump said on Friday that his country is "terminating" its relationship with the WHO. In a letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this month, Trump threatened to permanently cut off the nation's funding to the WHO and "reconsider our membership" if the international body does not commit to what he called "substantive improvements within the next 30 days."
