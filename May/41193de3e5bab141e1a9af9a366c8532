The European Commision will propose on Wednesday that Italy and Spain - the countries most affected by the coronavirus epidemic - get the lion's share of a new recovery fund offering a mix of grants and loans, a senior EU official said.

But it is the grants, financed through joint borrowing, that worry the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria and Denmark. The borrowing will have to be repaid, meaning higher national contributions to the EU budget in the future or new taxes assigned to the EU.The Commission is to propose such new taxes, following up on its proposal from 2018 when it asked EU governments to give it EU revenues from a tax on plastics and some money from the CO2 emissions trading scheme and national corporate taxes.Garnering no support for its ideas in 2018, the Commission also proposed to phase out all the rebates various countries enjoy on their national contributions to the EU budget, halve the amount of customs duties governments keep and acquire a bigger share of the Value Added Tax paid to the EU.The recovery money is to be spent by governments on making the transition to an economy that is climate neutral - emitting no more CO2 than it absorbs - by 2050 and more adapted to the digital age - both EU priorities. The eurozone economy is likely to shrink in 2020.Newspaper headline: EU to unveil massive stimulus plan for recovery
