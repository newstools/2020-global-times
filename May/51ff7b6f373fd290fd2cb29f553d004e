Special governmental bonds will also be issued to support the building of 5G base stations," the notice said. 5G technology, as a key element of China's new infrastructure initiative, plays a vital role in making the economy and society digitalized. While the specific value for 5G infrastructure projects this year remains elusive, total investments could reach 1.2 trillion yuan by 2025, a report by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said, noting that 5G investment could prompt an additional investment of 3.5 trillion in other related sectors.For Hubei, the motivation to develop 5G is more urgent than other parts of China, as the economy of the province contracted by 39.2 percent in the first quarter of this year after its capital, Wuhan, went through a 76-day lockdown to save lives and prevent the pandemic from spreading further across the country. In 2019, the total retail sales of consumer goods in Hubei exceeded 2 trillion yuan, but the coronavirus outbreak hit heavily on the province's consumption, especially in hotels, catering, tourism and auto sales, according to the Xinhua News Agency.The 30 measures included holding a shopping festival in June, stimulating entertainment and food consumption at night and facilitating the opening of tax-free shopping malls within the province. Meanwhile, new energy vehicle and rural auto buyers will receive subsidies. The cultural and tourism department of Hubei will also return 80 percent of the tourism quality deposit to travel agencies. Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
