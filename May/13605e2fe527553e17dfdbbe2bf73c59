(Xinhua/Ting Shen)Boeing said on Wednesday that it has resumed production of the 737 MAX at the company's Renton factory in Washington state.Boeing also confirmed in a statement that the 737 program will gradually ramp up production this year.The 737 program began building airplanes at a low rate as it implements more than a dozen initiatives focused on enhancing workplace safety and product quality, the statement said."We've been on a continuous journey to evolve our production system," said Walt Odisho, vice president and general manager of the 737 program. "These initiatives are the next step in creating the optimal build environment for the 737 MAX."During the temporary suspension of production that began in January, mechanics and engineers collaborated to refine and standardize work packages in each position of the factory. New processes will ensure that employees have everything they need to build the airplane, the company said.
