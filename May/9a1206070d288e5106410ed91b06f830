The negative list for foreign investment is being revised as part of the plan to shorten it and expand the catalog of industries where foreign investments are encouraged.Experts said the next opening-up area will be more detailed, such as health care, agricultural sectors, and the services industry. The impartial and fair market environment for domestic and foreign companies will not only help China achieve its development goals, but also provide vast opportunities for companies from all countries to cooperate in China, and promote in-depth development of multilateral and bilateral cooperation, Fabrice Megarbane, president and CEO of L'Oreal China, told the Global Times. "Our confidence in the Chinese market has never been stronger," he added. China's foreign trade is still under considerable downward pressure despite improvements in the April trade data, the country's commerce ministry said earlier this month.China's foreign trade of goods inched down 0.7 percent year on year in April to 2.5 trillion yuan ($352.6 billion), narrowing from a drop of 6.4 percent in the first quarter, with exports rising 8.2 percent from the same period last year, the customs data showed.Companies dedicated to foreign trade are facing many difficulties, including order cancellations or delays, difficulty in signing new orders, and poor logistics, said Gao Feng from the commerce ministry, citing surveys of domestic chambers of commerce and enterprises.Despite the epidemic's impact on foreign enterprises in China, there have been no large-scale foreign capital withdrawals from China, Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the third session of the 13th NPC said, adding that China's comprehensive advantage in using foreign capital has not changed, and foreign companies' confidence in long-term business development in China has not changed.While there has been talk of less reliance on China as a key supplier and manufacturing base, Edmund Yang, a Pricewaterhouse Coopers partner in Beijing, said in a note to the Global Times that any change will not have a significant impact in the foreseeable future because China is the well-established "world factory," and arranging supply alternatives is not easy for companies in the automotive and pharmaceutical industries. Liang said as the epidemic is under control in China, foreign firms in China could benefit from the system advantages to make their products serve the world.
