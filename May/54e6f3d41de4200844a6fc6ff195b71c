Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set out a gradual easing of lockdown measures in England from Monday.

The US is the WHO's biggest contributor, supplying $400 million in 2019.German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the "disappointing" decision was a setback for global health, while Chancellor Angela Merkel declined to attend an in-person G7 summit that Trump had suggested he would host.Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet medical journal, said it was "madness and terrifying both at the same time."As the virus progresses at different speeds around the globe, there has been pressure in many countries to lift crippling lockdowns, despite experts' warnings of a possible second wave of infections.In Britain, which is set to begin lifting its lockdown on Monday, senior advisors to the government warned that it was moving too quickly. India said Saturday it would begin relaxing the world's biggest lockdown in stages from early June, even as it marked another record daily rise in infections.Iran meanwhile announced that collective prayers would resume in mosques, despite infections ticking back upwards in the Middle East's hardest-hit country.AFP
