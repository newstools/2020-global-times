About 25 percent of them are above 60 years old. China as a whole saw 580,000 fewer newborns in 2019 than in 2018, marking the third consecutive year of decline since the implementation of the universal two-child policy in the mainland, according to official data.Supporters argued that the whole country should consider lifting the birth restrictions and some deputies have proposed furthering the two-child policy to allow a third child. The idea is to encourage young people to have children.But Northeast China faces another problem in addition to a low birth rate: a brain drain and stagnant local economies. "Even if people are born in the region, they'll prefer to work and live in big cities and coastal areas," said a net user on Sina Weibo.  All three provinces recorded GDP growth rates slower than the country's average and declined in GDP per capita. Zhai Zhenwu, president of the School of Sociology and Population Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that, based on his studies, the fertility rate of women in the three northeast provinces has been low for a long time, averaging around 1.2 children per woman compared with the country's 1.6-1.7.
