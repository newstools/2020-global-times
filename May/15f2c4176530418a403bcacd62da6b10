Such criminal activities are uncalled for in whatever form or manner, she added.“To this end, the Government of the Republic of Zambia has instituted investigations to bring the perpetrators of this gruesome act to justice and shall endeavor to continue strengthening measures to protect the lives of Chinese living in Zambia,” she stated.Chibesakunda stressed that Zambia has always been a peace sanctuary from time immemorial, having accommodated many foreign nationals including their close friends, the Chinese people.The opening of our country to trade and foreign direct investment, coupled with peaceful nature and warm cultural orientation of Zambians, has attracted many Chinese people to not only do business but work and live in Zambia, she said.She stated China-Zambia relations have existed for more than half a century, the foot print of these relations are visible through monumental emblems such as the TAZARA Railway line connecting Zambia to the port of Dar-es-salaam in Tanzania and various other infrastructure projects supported by China. The two countries also cooperated on COVID-19.“Simply, I wish to ascertain that the tragic murder of three Chinese nationals recently in Lusaka is an isolated case and will not in any way affect the warm and friendly relations between our two nations which are founded on mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” said Chibesakunda.She noted Zambia and China will continue to work together to achieve a shared goal of building a closer China-Africa community with a shared future which will eventually turn into a pacesetter for building a shared global community for mankind.
