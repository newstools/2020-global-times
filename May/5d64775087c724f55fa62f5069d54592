Gravedigger Junaidi Hakim shouts "hurry up" as he summons his weary colleagues in a never-ending race to bury novel coronavirus victims at a Jakarta cemetery.

Workers move aid packages for people in need amid coronavirus outbreak, at a distribution centre in Jakarta, Indonesia on Monday. Indonesia is drawing up a $1.0 billion rescue plan for struggling national airline Garuda after COVID-19 forced the company to ground most of its planes.

This is probably a test from God," he added.The challenges are compounded in the fasting month of Ramadan when many in Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim majority nation, don't eat or drink during daylight hours.Naman Suherman said he is able to overcome gnawing thirst and hunger in the belief he's doing something "noble" for victims whose covered burial pits are sprinkled with pink flowers."What strengthens my faith on this job is knowing that I can help take the deceased to their final resting place," the 55-year-old gravedigger said.How many people the virus has claimed across the Southeast Asian archipelago of more than 260 million is unclear.An official death toll of 1,191 as of Monday is widely believed to be well below reality, and Indonesia has one of the world's lowest testing rates.Government officials acknowledge data is patchy and incomplete.At least 2,107 people have been buried under COVID-19 safety protocols in epicenter Jakarta alone - nearly double the reported national toll.Other cities have also seen unusually high burial figures in recent months, suggesting even more victims.Volunteer database KawalCovid-19, which was created by health and technology professionals, has estimated there have been more than 3,000 virus deaths in just 16 of the country's 34 provinces.
