Workers at Yuyue Home Textile Co produce masks with a self-developed antibacterial new material and filter cloth in Binzhou, East China's Shandong Province on Sunday. The new material can both prevent bacteria and viruses. Over 3,000 companies in China added "masks, protective clothing, disinfectant and thermometers" to their business scope between January 1 and February 7, according to the Xinhua News Agency.

"In the short term, it will be very difficult to find a supplier that can deliver the goods in a short span and at a lower cost than those in China. That's the big picture," Bai told the Global Times, adding that he knows there are big export orders coming in, with some even calling for up to 200 million masks in a single deal.Data released by China customs on Sunday showed that, from March 1 to May 16, a total of 134.4 billion yuan ($18.8 billion) worth of anti-epidemic supplies were exported, including 50.9 billion masks. In addition, from January to April, exports of pandemic prevention materials such as masks and protective clothing grew rapidly, leading to a 5.9 percent increase in textile exports.With more than 10,000 factories, China has a much bigger capacity to meet rising demand, with some estimating China's output could meet 10 times the global demand for masks. But regulatory hurdles and misconceptions about the quality of Chinese-made masks have seriously undermined supply, according to industry insiders.  "Buyers in some foreign countries don't know much about China's mask industry," Bai said. Some believe wrongly that Chinese qualifications for mask production are not as good as in the West, which is not the case, as some medical supplies are not allowed to be sold in China even if they meet US standards, Bai added.Bai said that there are many qualified mask factories in China, but only around 5 percent have obtained certifications from Europe and the US, so much of the potential production capacity cannot be utilized.Concern over the quality of Chinese-made masks also stems from sub-standard masks procured by overseas middlemen, who tend to prioritize profits over quality, according to Chen Hongyan, a Beijing-based industry analyst of medical supplies."These suppliers offer low prices but they do not meet the standards, and they certainly cannot represent the majority of Chinese mask suppliers, but the middlemen only care about profits, not quality," Chen told the Global Times. She said that China has already moved to crack down on those suppliers.Still, rigid demand for protective items such as masks will continue to mount. The US and some European countries did not pay adequate attention to masks in their prevention and control of the pandemic and now they are catching up, especially as they reopen their economies, industry analysts said.Global novel coronavirus cases exceeded 5 million as of Thursday afternoon, Beijing time, with the US continuing to lead at 1.5 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.Newspaper headline: Foreign orders for Chinese masks pour in
