I expect there will be a breakthrough in 3-5 years, maybe even sooner," Xiang said.Other than the integrated circuit industry, Chen, who has been working with Shanghai's economy and information departments, also suggested the country should increase scientific and technological innovation in Shanghai with more pilot programs to adapt to new technologies and products.For example, Xiang suggested the country modify traffic regulations and allow Shanghai to test driverless vehicles on open roads while exploring how traffic violations should be handled. Chen also called upon the city to carry out more international innovation cooperation at the Lingang New Area inside the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, to support and promote more innovation initiatives.
