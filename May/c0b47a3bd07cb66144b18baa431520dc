We've been doing this 19, coming on 20 years and dogs and directors never fail to come up with the goods," he added.Indeed Tarantino admitted that he had his eye on the collar in 2019 for "my wonderful actress Brandy," a pit bull who liked to chomp cans of tinned rat and who savaged the baddies in the gory final scene of Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood."I'm not going to give this to her - it'll go on my mantelpiece," he proudly told AFP after the dog who very nearly upstaged Brad Pitt won the award.Uggie's trainer Omar von Muller, who also worked on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, said winning the Palm Dog was the launchpad for The Artist and its fairytale Oscar success."At the time we really didn't know how the movie would do and that's when the whole thing started going everywhere," he told AFP from his home north of Los Angeles, which is festooned with portraits of Uggie.'He loved the attention'"Uggie was a very, very special friend. He was a family member... He loved to work and the attention he got on set. He will be in our hearts forever," Von Muller said."Things like the Palm Dog are very important for us because it recognizes the work" dog trainers do, he said.Von Muller said they were no secrets to training dogs other than having heart and passion and making sure the dogs "enjoy what they're doing without ever being pressured... It starts very slowly, with a lot of patience and a lot love for the dogs."Rose said the Palm Dog has since expanded its scope with its "Dogmanitarian" prize, honoring among others the British social realist master Ken Loach, who has made three-legged dogs a fixture in his films."It represents the underdog," for which Loach has fought throughout his long career, Rose said. "Ken was so fabulously embracing of the idea and even told us about the castings," he told AFP.Can you imagine, Rose joked, "having to say to a three-legged dog, 'Sorry you ain't got the role.'"  Newspaper headline: Good doggie
