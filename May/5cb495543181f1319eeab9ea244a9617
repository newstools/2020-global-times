Bai noted that this is exactly what the US is trying to do. "If Japan wants to establish a green channel with China, first of all, don't follow the US," he added. Learning that there is a "fast track" entry system between China and South Korea, Takehiko Saeki, chief representative of the Japan External Trade Organization's (JETRO) Wuhan office told the Global Times that Japanese companies in China very much hope that a similar channel could be opened between China and Japan to facilitate the heads of Japanese companies returning to China.According to a document posted online, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) will temporarily adjust its policy and give "green channels" to chartered flights. Eight countries - Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland - are on the list.On Wednesday afternoon, two chartered flights took off from Japan's Kansai International Airport bound for Wuhan Tianhe Airport. On the flight were 136 Japanese nationals returning to their work positions in China, many from Nissan Motor and Honda Motor, media reports said.However, due to the lack of a China-Japan fast-track entry system like the one between China and South Korea, which enables travelers' 14-day COVID-19 quarantines to be shortened to one or two days, the Japanese employees have to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival in China.It is notable that exchanges between Chinese and South Korean top officials are much more frequent than those between Chinese and Japanese officials, Gao said, suggesting Japanese politicians should have clear minds when considering bilateral relations. China is willing to open "fast track" entry systems with more countries in addition to South Korea in order to promote production recovery, but these countries should reciprocate in kind and not let politics get in the way of bilateral economic exchanges, experts said.
