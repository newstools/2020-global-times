"We will be looking to expect that to come down further," she said.Encouragingly, Britain is also maintaining a downward trend in new confirmed cases, she said.During the briefing, Shapps announced the government is investing 283 million pounds (344.3 million U.S. dollars) into the public transport system to increase both frequency and capacity of services while ensuring there is enough space on vehicles to allow for social distancing."We now have opportunity to use power of transport to improve longstanding national weaknesses," he said.The transport secretary said the measures are "not just to get through (the crisis) but come out of the recovery stronger by permanently changing how we use transport"."Transport is not just how we get from place to place, but it shapes the places," he said.The funding would be divided into 254 million pounds (309 million dollars) for buses and 29 million pounds (35.3 million dollars) for trams and light rail, according to Shapps."The mission is to level up Britain," he said, "The COVID outbreak must be the catalyst for getting it done."
