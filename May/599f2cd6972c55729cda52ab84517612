Customers, domestic or abroad, can pick their favorite satellites and put them into shopping carts on their phone, and even talk to customer service personnel about details of their purchases.The price of the services was not shown on the platform. A CASC insider who is familiar with the platform told the Global Times on Thursday that "due to the satellite merchandise being fairly expensive, the platform currently only displays key technological specifications online, without naming the price, in order to avoid unnecessary hassles."After putting the merchandise into their shopping carts, customers can talk directly to the customer service online and ask about a deal. Down payments are essential, he noted.
