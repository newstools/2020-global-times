Many adaptions of Japanese manga, such as Dragon Ball, Case Closed and Attack on Titan, didn't get a good reception from fans," a One Piece fan called "Xiaozui Luanwen" on Sina Weibo told the Global Times on Thursday."Live-action adaptations of Japanese manga are really difficult as manga characters have exaggerated facial expressions and gestures and unique designs of their hair and clothes, which will be impossible and embarrassing for real people to act," he noted."The best part of manga is that most of its background settings are based on imagination, which feeds our passions and enthusiasm in real life," he added.But some netizens said they looked forward to the show and hoped their favorite movie stars can be chosen for the adaption.The story of One Piece takes place on an alternate version of Earth and talks about a young boy named Monkey D. Luffy who has dreams of raising his own crew and finding the mythical treasure known as "One Piece" and declaring himself Pirate King.According to Netflix, the producer of the show Marty Adelstein said that filming is set to take place in Cape Town in South Africa, and the show will come out in 2021 at the earliest.
