However, due to the shutdown and suspension of production, the government's tax revenue dropped. Resuming work and production requires financial support. As local financial resources have been strained, Zhu suggested the country exempt the province from taxation in 2020 and 2021. Taxes collected from enterprises and individuals will be held by the local government. Zhu also proposed to allocate a special fund from the national financial budget for the province to help it restore social economy and order quickly. Millions of Hubei residents were quarantined during the lockdown. They made great sacrifices and contributions to win the battle against COVID-19 at an early date. Hubei is in urgent need of policy support from the country to minimize the loss caused by the epidemic, Zhu said.
