However, the current assessment of their situation largely relies on observation by an experienced physician, which is subjective and has a rate of misdiagnosis of around 40 percent.The research team found that, when patients receive speech with word-, phrase- and sentence-level structures, the brain activity recorded by the EEG reflects their cognitive level, which could help determine their conscious level. These EEG-derived neural signals, including both speech-tracking responses and temporal dynamics of global brain states, are associated with behavioral diagnosis of consciousness.Crucially, as multiple EEG measures in the language paradigm were able to predict future outcomes in individual patients, EEG-based language assessment provides a new and reliable approach for objectively characterizing and predicting states of consciousness and to longitudinally track individual patients' language processing abilities at the bedside, the research team told the Global Times on Tuesday. According to the research team, the new approach has successfully and accurately predicted individual patients' recovery from consciousness disorder after 100 days with an accuracy of 80 percent.Also, although neuroimaging studies, like fMRI, have demonstrated a potential for informing diagnosis and prognosis in unresponsive patients, these expensive methods involve sophisticated brain imaging technologies and several restrictions, which limit their clinical application.The EEG-based study of patients' language processing abilities at the bedside are expected to fix the limitations of neuroimaging studies and provide accurate predictions, the Global Times was told.
