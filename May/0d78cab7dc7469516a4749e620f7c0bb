Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque reopened to worshippers on Sunday after a two-and-a-half month coronavirus closure, but Muslim authorities imposed some precautions as health officials warn of an uptick in local infections.

Thanks be to God," Jerusalem resident Umm Hisham said through a face mask, her eyes tearing up, after entering the compound for dawn prayers with hundreds of other Muslims.The Council of Islamic Waqf cited the slowed local spread of COVID-19 in lifting entry restrictions and reopening the compound's iconic shrines, which shut on March 15.But the council imposed some measures to reduce the risk of contagion, as new cases in Israel spiked in recent days.Worshippers must wear face masks and bring personal prayer rugs should they wish to pray inside the shrines or on the compound's outdoor grounds. There did not appear to be a limit on the number of people allowed into the 14-hectare compound, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.Â  Around 700 worshippers were present for dawn prayers.Newspaper headline: Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem reopens
