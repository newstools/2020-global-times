(Xinhua/Rachen Sageamsak)Thai Prime Minister said Tuesday he feared a second wave of COVID-19 infections will emerge if the emergency decree ends with Thais becoming less vigilant and letting their guards down, after the Cabinet meeting approved the extension of the emergency until the end of June.“It will be a complete waste of time and energy and effort we put in trying to contain the pandemic,” said Prayut on Tuesday, adding that currently Thailand is witnessing only single digit new cases of COVID-19 as a result of stringent measures to contain the outbreak.Prayut was responding to criticisms from the opposition groups, business sectors impacted by closures and travel restrictions.The emergency decree is a far better tool than other laws because it unites virus control efforts under one command, said an assertive Prayut.Defending the prime minister’s decision to extend the state of emergency, spokesman for the Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA), Dr. Taweesin Visanuyothin said, “please remain vigilant, wear masks, wash your hands and practice social distancing. This, will help Thailand in the next phase of lockdown easing.”Taweesin said that public health officials have noticed that people are becoming less vigilant as the number of new daily infections drops.The CCSA doctor said Thailand should keep the state of emergency momentum, adding that lockdown measures will no longer be necessary if the number of new daily infections is kept below 5 per 1 million people.“For example, Bangkok has a population of 8 million. If the number of Covid-19 patients is 40, transmission is considered limited,” said Taweesin.The Thai Prime Minister said he understood all sectors' grievances and reminded all that there is nothing more vital than the health being of all Thai people.
