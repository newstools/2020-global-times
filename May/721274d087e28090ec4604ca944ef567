From rural villages in Malawi to the war-torn streets of north-west Cameroon, rising numbers of female radio hosts are taking to the air to dispel fake news and myths about the novel coronavirus whilst also tackling sexism.

We explained what coronavirus is and what actions our government is taking," said Shapwanale, 30, a radio host with Eagle FM radio in the capital Windhoek."People initially believed that 5G had caused coronavirus, or that it was man-made or that Chinese people were intentionally bringing the virus into our country," she said. "We immediately educated people on the facts."Namibia has about 20 confirmed cases of the virus and no deaths, according to a global tally from Johns Hopkins University of Medicine."Because our numbers are low, people are not social distancing. We are trying to explain the importance of wearing masks and staying home," said Shapwanale in a phone interview.Further east in Malawi, a southern African country of about 17.5 million, radio host Meclina Chirwa is doing the same from the capital city Lilongwe. This is not the first time that Chirwa, 30, has used radio to dispel myths around health issues, having brought tuberculosis (TB) experts on to her show in the past to challenge misconceptions.Her new show, called "Let's talk about Corona," continues to use expert interviews to challenge coronavirus fake news on Timveni Radio Station that has a wide reach into rural areas."As journalists, we need to tell the truth, and we can do this using radio to reach the rural masses," said Chirwa.SexismAmid the urgency to get accurate coronavirus information out to listeners, these female radio hosts said they also share another experience - regular sexual advances from male sources."It is not even surprising any more when this happens," said Shapwanale. "We are made to feel objectified, and have to work extra hard to prove we can pull off a good story as well as our male colleagues."Pushing back against fear to go out and report is a common experience for Kimah, especially as coronavirus cases continue to rise.Cameroon has about 5,400 confirmed coronavirus cases, and 175 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University."We are scared of the unforeseen, but we cannot miss out because we are scared. Inform somebody about where you are going, put on your press jacket and go," she said.Not doing so means male counterparts get all the good stories, leaving female reporters struggling to build their careers, said Kimah.She said she was on her way to the radio studio in Bamenda early one morning when she was stopped by the police. "They accused me of promoting violence through my work," she said. Newspaper headline: Freedom on the air
