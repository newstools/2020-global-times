He referred to seven male nurses aged 30 or below at his hospital, who often uninterruptedly worked for more than seven hours in isolation areas, and voluntarily shouldered additional responsibilities like cleaning medical wasteamid the pandemic."Millennials have shown with their actions that they are the future and hope of China," he said.A day earlier, the 13th CPPCC member Wang Chen, an academician and president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, who proposed building Fangcang makeshift hospitals for COVID-19 patients in early February, shared his thoughts at a routine group interview ahead of the opening meeting of the annual CPPCC session on Thursday.The fight against the epidemic embodies a characteristic of Chinese culture - a genuine respect for people's life and health, Wang said. The high professional spirit and hardwork of the Chinese medical personnel make them a significant force that bolsters this fight, he added.The remarks, related to the COVID-19 fight, of NPC deputies and CPPCC members at the two sessions group interviews impressed many citizens. Some said the stories brought flashbacks of the Chinese public, together with medical workers, tiding over the most difficult times.  Ysan (pseudonym), a Hubei resident who spent 68 days in the province's Xianning city before leaving for Guangzhou in late March, said the remarks brought him a sense of benevolence. He recalled a viral photo of a doctor and an 87-year-old COVID-19 patient watching the sunset together in Hubei's capital Wuhan on March 5. The photo and the stories shared at the two sessions, are all small fragments of ordinary life, infused with "warmth and humanistic care," Ysan told the Global Times Friday.
