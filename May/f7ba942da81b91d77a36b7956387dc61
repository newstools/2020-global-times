A leading publisher called Thursday for Google and other tech giants to pay Australian news outlets some US$400 million a year under a mandatory code of conduct ordered by the government.

"In fact, using it to boost their own revenues and taking the advertising which otherwise would go to support that journalism."The government said it was imposing the code of conduct after months of negotiations on a voluntary agreement with Google, Facebook and other companies failed to reach an agreement.Google and Facebook protested the move and called for continued negotiations. Both companies also insist they have invested millions of dollars in initiatives in helping Australia's struggling news industry.Costello dismissed the need for further talks, saying the best way to address the issue is "an industry solution, where you sit down and try to estimate the value that Google and Facebook are getting from the use of this material. We think it's A$600 million a year.""These are trillion-dollar corporates, it's not as if it's going to undermine their profitability if they had to pay A$600 million in revenue for copyright in Australia - and I hope they would see it that way," he said.Google and Facebook have had a huge impact on Australia's news industry, capturing two-thirds of online advertising spending.In response to falling revenues, Australian news outlets have slashed 20 percent of jobs since 2014.
