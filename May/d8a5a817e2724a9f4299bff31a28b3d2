The move between China and South Korea is reasonable and practical to resume business activities, as well as production and work, on the premise of epidemic prevention and control, Zhou noted.Shanghai-based news site ThePaper.cn reported on Monday that international airlines are planning to increase flights to China in June, as the public looks forward to a gradual relaxation of travel restrictions due to the outbreak.According to the report, South Korea's Asiana Airlines plans to resume 12 routes to China in June, while Korean Air is making preparations to restart flights to the country.Also, Qatar Airways said it expects to serve passengers flying to Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai by the end of June, and Turkish Airlines plans to resume flights to Shanghai in June.The border lockdown is a temporary emergency measure in response to the pandemic, and it won't last long as cases of the virus tail off in some countries, Wang said, noting that in the era of economic globalization, easing the restrictions can help revive business activity.At the same time, Wang said that easing the epidemic control should be carried out step by step, along with improving medical testing and quarantine ability.Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, said at a press conference on Monday that more than 100,000 new cases were confirmed in a single day on Sunday for the first time, bringing the total number to more than 4.52 million worldwide.Mi said China will conduct test all inbound and outbound passengers and staff participating in immigration and transshipment work, strengthen closed-loop management and prevent local outbreaks from imported cases.
