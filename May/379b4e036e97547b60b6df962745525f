A total of around 50 people have been quarantined.The question of allowing religious services is particularly sensitive in Germany and beyond.In France, a week-long gathering organized by an evangelical church at the end of February, attended by some 2,000 people, was the source of dozens of outbreaks across the country.In the US, President Donald Trump on Friday called on state governors to authorize the opening of places of worship.AFP
