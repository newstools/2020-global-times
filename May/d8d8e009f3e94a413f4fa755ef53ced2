President Barack Obama wipes his tears as he speaks at McCormick Place in Chicago on Tuesday, giving his presidential farewell address. Photo: APFormer US president Barack Obama on Saturday criticized the response to the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging America, in what was widely regarded as a rare public rebuke of his successor Donald Trump.His remarks came as he spoke at two virtual commencements for high school and university students locked down instead of celebrating their graduations, a rite of passage every spring in the US."More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing," Obama told graduates from several dozen historically black colleges and universities at the first ceremony."A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge," he said as he discussed the implications of the pandemic during the online event, without naming any specific leaders.That celebration was followed by a second, star-studded prime-time ceremony for high school students in which Obama continued along the same lines, telling students to step up where leaders had failed."If the world is going to get better, it's going to be up to you," he said."Doing what feels good, what's convenient, what's easy - that's how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way - which is why things are so screwed up.""I hope that instead, you decide to ground yourself in values that last, like honesty, hard work, responsibility, fairness, generosity, respect for others," he noted.The ceremony, carried by all the major American television networks, flashed between stirring speeches and performances made by students and celebrities alike, including basketball superstar Lebron James and singers the Jonas Brothers.James echoed Obama's call for the students to step up, urging them to "stay close to home" and help rebuild communities devastated by the virus and shutdowns.The US leads the world with coronavirus cases and deaths, at 1.4 million and nearly 90,000, respectively.2020's graduates face a grim reality: The US unemployment rate has shot up to nearly 15 percent and more than 36 million people have filed for unemployment benefits as America grapples with the fallout from months of lockdown and business closings.The gravity of Obama's message was underscored by the fact it was the second time in a week he had hit out at the response to the pandemic, having pointedly refused to criticize Trump in public in the three years since leaving office. He kept his profile low despite being frequently attacked by the president.But on May 9, in remarks leaked from a web call with people who worked in his administration, he called Trump's handling of the pandemic a catastrophe.AFP
