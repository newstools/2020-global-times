The Chinese government vowed to firmly prevent the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic and resolutely safeguard people's health, a government work report submitted to the national legislature for deliberation stated Friday.  Premier Li Keqiang delivered the work report to the 3rd session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing on Friday. Li said China is committed to reform disease prevention and control system, improve infectious disease direct reporting and warning system, timely and transparently release epidemic-related information, and increase investment on vaccine research and rapid testing.China will expand medical facilities for epidemic prevention and treatment, increase mobile laboratories, intensify support for emergency supplies, and strengthen community-level health and epidemic prevention efforts, to greatly improve prevention capability,Li said.China will accelerate the establishment of national laboratories and reorganize other key laboratories, Li said.He added that several loopholes have been exposed in the public health emergency management sector during COVID-19 prevention and control, and thus suggestions from the public should be taken into consideration with utmost seriousness. China will allocate 605 billion yuan ($85 billion) for special transfer payments used mainly to ensure basic livelihood of the people, build the public health and emergency supplies support system and cope with uncertainty, in the next six months, according to the government report.China will strengthen cooperation with other countries in COVID-19 epidemic prevention, promote world economic stability, advance global governance, safeguard the international system with the UN at its core, and shield the international order based on international law.The biggest loophole in China's disease prevention and warning mechanism is that some local governments neglect the reporting and warning protocol for virus outbreaks, fearing that outbreak may affect their performances, Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Global Times on Friday. To plug this loophole, Zeng believes, it must be ensured that the local governments strictly abide by the country’s laws and regulations.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
