She delivers for Amazon, but Adrienne Williams says the e-commerce and tech giant did not deliver for her.

But she has not received anything.Amazon says it has some 800 third-party delivery providers globally, but did not provide details on the number of people working for the enterprises.Amazon said in 2019 that it would offer its employees $10,000 to quit their jobs and create their own delivery business for Amazon packages. But Amazon has canceled contracts with some operators that failed to live up to its standards."When the virus hits it became apparent how much the DSPs are not financially able to really take care of their businesses the way they should," Williams said.She said the services have been struggling and sometimes failing to deal with sanitizing vehicles and training drivers.On May 1, she joined a protest in front of an Amazon warehouse in Richmond, California, wearing a black mask and holding a sign saying, "I should be able to pay rent if I work full time."
