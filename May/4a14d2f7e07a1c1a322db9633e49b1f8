Photo:XinhuaRumors cannot defeat the virus, smearing cannot overcome the pandemic, Chinese FM spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Thursday after the FBI released an announcement claiming that China is stealing US information regarding research on COVID-19 drugs, vaccines and treatment. Previous records tell us that the US has launched the largest acts of cyber espionage. As China makes great achievements in the anti-virus battle and leading in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine development, it is China that should worry about research data being stolen, Zhao said at a routine press conference. The remarks came after the FBI released a joint announcement with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday, claiming that they are investigating "the targeting and compromising of US organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and non-traditional gatherers." China expresses strong disappointment and firmly opposes the statement, Zhao noted. China is one of the victims who suffer the most from cyber-espionage and always crack down on all forms of hacking and cyber attacks in accordance with the law, he said. Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
