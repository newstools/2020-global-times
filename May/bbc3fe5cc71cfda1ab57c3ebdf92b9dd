Detroit's auto giants are keen to resume production this week, but there will be unease on assembly lines where social distancing is difficult and worries about the deadly coronavirus persist.

But not everyone is convinced."I am expecting a bumpy ride," said one United Auto Workers official, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The "Big Three," which have the experience of relaunching in Asia, have set their US restart for Monday.That is the same day Tesla has been cleared by local regulators in California to resume full production following a faceoff between public health officials and brash Tesla boss Elon Musk that apparently was resolved with a compromise on enhanced safety measures.Unlike California, Michigan has been the site of armed marches to the state capitol in protest over restrictions imposed by Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Under pressure from the state's automotive suppliers and carmakers, she modified her stay-at-home orders to allow for the resumption of manufacturing with social distancing.After effectively shutting down in March to combat the deadly virus, US carmakers say they are now ready to get back to business."Above everything else, our top priority has always been to do what is right for our employees," Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley said in a statement this week. "We have worked closely with the unions to establish protocols that will ensure our employees feel safe at work and that every step possible has been taken to protect them."The monumental tasks at FCA include sanitizing 5.3 million square meters of production space and implementing new disinfection schedules to maintain hygiene. Some 4,700 work stations were modified to allow for social distancing.Temperature checks and daily health self-screening are required for all employees and visitors; start times will be staggered; and break and lunch times will be altered to increase social distancing. Everyone will have to wear face masks and safety goggles, FCA officials said.Manley said FCA was using what it has learned from opening plants in China and Italy as it resumes production in the US, Mexico and Canada.General Motors and Ford have described similar measures.Jim Glynn, a vice president for workplace safety at GM, said on a conference call that workers will follow a strict protocol each day beginning with filling out a questionnaire and having a temperature scan. However, none of the companies will test employees regularly. Kiersten Robinson, Ford's chief human resources officer, said during a conference call there is not enough capacity for regular tests. Lack of testing is an issue for the UAW, which has stopped short of endorsing the industry's return to work model. The union also pressed GM, Ford and FCA to relax their policies on absenteeism so workers will stay home or self-quarantine if they feel ill."We have made it clear in our talks that we are asking for as much testing as possible at the current time," said UAW President Rory Gamble. Newspaper headline: Unease among Motor City carmakers
