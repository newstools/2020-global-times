The Chinese Navy also said in February that no sailor on the Shandong was infected with COVID-19 and all training and testing work was being carried out according to schedule.China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, in April conducted deep sea cross-regional mobilization exercises featuring comprehensive back-to-back attack-defense mock battles in the South China Sea, according to reports.
