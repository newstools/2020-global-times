Zhang and renowned respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan have suggested people drink more milk to boost their immunity.The production of COVID-19 antibodies is helped by greater protein intake, Zhang told the China Business News. "Enough nutrition and protein are a key factor in turning severe coronavirus cases into mild ones," he said.COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms or those in recovery should consume one egg and 300 grams of milk or other dairy product every day, and 250-400 grams of grains or potatoes, 150-200 grams of meat, fish or shrimps, over 500 grams of vegetables, 200-350 grams of fruits and 1.5 to 2 liters of water, according to a dietary guideline that China's National Health Commission released in February.Severely ill COVID-19 patients should take high-quality proteins by having digestible food such as eggs, beans, milk, rice flour, and fruit and vegetable juices, read the guideline. Those who are too sick to eat normally can get their nutrition from a tube inserted through their nose, it added.The guideline also suggests healthy people eat "moderate amounts" of fish, meat and eggs.There is no need for healthy adults to eat three to four eggs a day, Fan told the Global Times. "It's okay to have seven eggs a week - one per day on average," she said, adding that many sources of protein can raise a person's cholesterol level which is harmful to health.
