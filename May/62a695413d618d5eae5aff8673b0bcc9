Juveniles need to bravely say no to school bullying. O is off, meaning that they need to leave instantly. And T is talk, which means that they should seek help from adults and talk to parents or teachers," the prosecutor said."My major is law, and dream place is SPP. Following Wang, I explored my ideal workplace in advance! Thank you, Junkai!" said one netizen on Weibo.Another Weibo user thanked Wang for asking about school bullying and the solutions available for juveniles.Â SPP Procurator-General Zhang Jun will deliver a work report on Monday at the 3rd session of the 13th CPPCC National Committee that opened at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Thursday, China Youth Daily reported.
