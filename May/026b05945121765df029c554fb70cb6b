The discovery of the Hemudu site in 1973 established a new historical view that both the Yangtze River basin and the Yellow River basin are cradles of Chinese civilization.The shell mound, a type of ancient human settlement site, is characterized by a large number of discarded shells left over from the food eaten by ancient humans.
