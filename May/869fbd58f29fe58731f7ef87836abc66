Policy makers are also considering cash injections for companies of all sizes.Ministry of Finance (MOF) data on Thursday showed Japan's exports fell 21.9 percent in April year-on-year as US-bound shipments slumped 37.8 percent, the fastest decline since 2009, with car exports there plunging 65.8 percent.Global automakers are struggling to cope with the health crisis, which has pummeled car sales due to lockdowns in many countries.
