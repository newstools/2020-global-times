This temporary curfew is intended to preserve the health and safety of our residents by keeping our streets safe and accessible for essential workers and first responders," said Durkan.The temporary curfew does not impact people who need to commute to work during these hours, people experiencing homelessness, people in a medical emergency or people in a dangerous situation, first responders, health care workers, and news media. In addition, the curfew does not require businesses to close while it is in effect. It will not alter public transit schedules.The city does not intend to enforce the curfew, except for violations that result in public health and safety threats including fires, extensive property damage, and violence, the announcement said.
