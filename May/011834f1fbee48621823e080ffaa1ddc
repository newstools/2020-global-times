Photo: AFPThe world's biggest economy faces a severe downturn but will not suffer another Great Depression, US Fed chief Jerome Powell said on Sunday, as three hardest-hit countries in Europe reported low death tolls and lockdowns eased.Italy recorded the fewest deaths from coronavirus, 145, in one day since its two-month lockdown began, while Spain had 87 new virus-related deaths - the first time the number has fallen below 100 in two months.Restaurants, bars and cafes will be among the businesses allowed to reopen from Monday in Italy, and Spain will also further relax its lockdown measures, except in Madrid and Barcelona.Britain also registered its lowest daily increase since late March, with 170 fatalities. However, that number did not include Northern Ireland due to a technical issue - and these figures are often lower on weekends due to lags in reporting.With the worldwide viral death toll above 315,000 and the global economy reeling from the vast damage caused by stay-at-home orders, numerous European countries are lifting restrictions to provide much-needed respite for their beleaguered and impatient populations.Weekend leisure-seekers enjoyed reopened beaches in France, Greece and Italy, and Britons basked in sunny parks.In the US, too, with more than 30 million jobs destroyed, states have begun reopening even though federal guidelines for a two-week decline in cases have not always been met.The US economy could "easily" collapse by 20 to 30 percent this quarter, and unemployment could peak at 20 to 25 percent, but, "it should be a much shorter downturn than you would associate with the 1930s," Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, said on CBS's "60 Minutes."On Sunday, the US also recorded its lowest daily death toll in a week, at 820, but the country with the world's highest number of coronavirus fatalities neared 90,000 dead.Elsewhere, the virus - which has infected 4.7 million people globally - is still surging.Brazil's number of deaths soared past 16,000 with more than 240,000 infections, making it the country with the fourth-highest number of cases.On the other side of the Atlantic, South Africa reported 1,160 new infections, the highest daily number since March when the country recorded its first case.A semblance of normality returned to the sports world on the weekend, in the US, Europe and Asia.A NASCAR motor race before empty stands at the Darlington Raceway in South Carolina was the sport's first live competition since March 8.In South Korea, the world's first big-purse post-coronavirus golf tournament - the Korean LPGA Championship - wrapped up on Sunday.Germany's Bundesliga on the weekend became the first top football league to return after lockdown, bringing relief not only to European football fans but to a sports-starved world.
