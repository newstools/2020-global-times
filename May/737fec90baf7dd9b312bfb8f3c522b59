Some US politicians have been spreading lies and misinformation all day long, and the Xinhua News Agency has collected at least 24 lies and truths. Shouldn't Twitter verify all the comments made by these American politicians?" Zhao said at Friday's media briefing. One of Zhao's posts published on March 12 was marked with an exclamation point and followed with a text that read, "Get the facts about COVID-19."In the post, Zhao recommended an article of a Canadian research organization that said further evidence showed the novel coronavirus originated in the US. Global Times
