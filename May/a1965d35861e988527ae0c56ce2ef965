The Sunday protests were quickly dispersed by police.The national security law for Hong Kong is looming as the draft decision on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for HKSAR to safeguard national security was submitted to China's top legislature on Friday during the ongoing two sessions - the country's most important annual political event. The draft stipulates that the relevant legislative responsibilities of the National People's Congress Standing Committee aim to effectively prevent, stop, and punish any activity occurring in the HKSAR territory that attempts to split the country, subvert state power, organize and perpetrate terrorist activities, including other actions that seriously endanger national security.  Hong Kong residents from all walks of life collected online signatures and held a gathering on Sunday to show their support for the draft bill to safeguard the national security law to be implemented in Hong Kong. As of Sunday evening, more than 100,000 people had signed the online petition, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Global Times
