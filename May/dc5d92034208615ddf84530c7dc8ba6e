He called for financial diagnosis and precise responses to potential risks.The nation will step up its push for new financial laws and rules, including the central bank law, the commercial banking law, deposit insurance regulations, and local financial supervision regulations, Lu revealed at the forum, urging more efforts in making the financial secttors more market-oriented and law-governed.In a sign of progress, the Shanghai Financial Court, the first and only one of its kind in China with only 28 judges, had closed 10,630 cases as of April since its establishment in August 2018, involving over 227.7 billion yuan ($32.06 billion), Xiao Kai, vice president of the court, disclosed at the forum.As part of efforts to improve the rule of law in the financial arena, the court earlier this year introduced the nation's first mechanism for securities dispute litigation representatives that includes the Chinese version of class action lawsuits.Starbucks rival Luckin Coffee has been embroiled in a sales fraud scandal since early April when the NASDAQ-traded Chinese coffee chain revealed findings of an internal probe, shining attention on information disclosure by and financial integrity of Chinese firms.A toughening regulatory clampdown on accounting fraud and other kinds of financial misconduct has been pledged accordingly.The nation will hold a zero tolerance policy toward financial fraud, among other malicious unlawful and irregular practices, Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said on the annual national investor protection publicity day which fell on Friday this year. The revised Securities Law has massively increased legal liabilities for severe violations such as financial fraud, according to Yi, pledging that the commission will make full use of its supervision authority empowered by the new law, meting out heftier penalties.Modern information and technology tools including big data and artificial intelligence will be fully tapped to improve oversight and law enforcement efficacy, he said.  In a fresh ruling, the CSRC announced on Thursday a fine of 600,000 yuan, the maximum for securities violations, for Shanghai-listed Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. The firm's 21 employees were ordered to pay fines of between 100,000 yuan and 900,000 yuan and six executives were blacklisted by the securities regulator for 10 years to a lifetime.The major Chinese drug maker, previously a constituent of MSCI's global indices, said in April 2019 that it overstated cash by nearly 30 billion yuan in 2017 due to an "accounting error."Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
