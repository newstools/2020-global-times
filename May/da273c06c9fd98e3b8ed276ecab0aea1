It did not mention if the aircraft carrier would be taking part in the mission.The Shandong was commissioned by the PLA Navy on December 17, with a ceremony held at a naval base in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, after which it sailed back to the Dalian Shipyard in late December for maintenance.Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie told the Global Times that after the long distance round trip from Dalian to Sanya, the Shandong needed time to make improvements and calibrations based on possible problems it encountered.This training mission will likely test if every adjustment is working well, Li predicted, noting the Shandong is now laying the foundation for forming initial operational capability.When the Shandong left the shipyard, no aircraft was spotted on the fight deck based on photos and videos taken by local residents. But the CCTV report showed J-15 fighter jets on the carrier.This probably means the fighter jet takeoff and landing missions are part of the training, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Wednesday.
