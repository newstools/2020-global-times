"It still needs scientists' continuous effort in determining the intermediate host of coronavirus, and carrying out comprehensive and detailed virus-tracing studies."This finding echoes WHO and several COVID-19 studies of global research teams that have suggested COVID-19 origins unknown. "...be so critical of China (for the virus) is not only unfair, but plainly incorrect and factually untrue," Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of the British-based medical journal The Lancet, told media on May 1.The study also found that the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity, which "seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm," read the Nature article, adding that they are the key warning factors for some cases deteriorating to severe ones.Even though 90 percent of the cases the Shanghai team researched were patients with mild symptoms, there were a few cases that could deteriorate to serious pneumonia and even deadly respiratory failure, the researcher introduced. "To reduce the incidence of severe cases, medical workers can assess the patients' situations based on these factors and make targeted treatment plans," she said.Some targeted treatments for severe patients, including treatment of underlying disease, active anti-inflammatory therapy, convalescent plasma immunotherapy and tocilizumab on cytokine storm, have been proved effective in clinical practice, she added.The team consisted of members from Shanghai's scientific research and medical institutions including Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and Shanghai Institute of Hematology.Its study provides Chinese experiences in the fight against the virus to the world, the team said.
