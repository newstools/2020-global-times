Jian was found to have sold drugs to clients in various provinces including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hainan and Shandong, Shandong Radio & TV Station reported Monday.As China's Regulations on Detention Centers says people with mental illness or acute infectious diseases cannot be detained, Jian used his condition as an AIDS patient to continuously contact and open up new drug purchase and sales channels through the relatively hidden gay social network.Most of the criminals involved in this case are gay men with AIDS, including university teachers, college students and company staff. After making contact on gay social networks, they met at night in private locations such as friends' houses or rented houses, as police strictly control public places like hotels and bars.Global Times
