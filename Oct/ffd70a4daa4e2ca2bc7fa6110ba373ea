Some German politicians even published irresponsible remarks.Recently, some German politicians have ignored the one-China principle, hyped China's internal affairs issues including the Taiwan question and the national security law for Hong Kong, interfered in China's internal affairs, which was despised by the Chinese people. This cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China, nor change the Chinese people's strong determination to defend territorial integrity and achieve reunification of the country.In early October, German Ambassador to the UN, Christoph Heusgen, on behalf of 39 countries, attacked China on human rights issues, especially those in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. However, on the same occasion, 45 countries stated support for China in its policies on Xinjiang and 55 countries for its policies on Hong Kong affairs. Global Times
