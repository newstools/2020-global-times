It also has 16 indigenous Maori MPs, the first leader of African origin, Ibrahim Omar, and Vanushi Walters of Sri Lankan origin."This is the most diverse parliament we have ever had in terms of gender, and minority ethnic and indigenous representation," said Professor Paul Spoonley from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Massey University.It is also expected to be the most rainbow representative parliament system in the world, with about 10 percent of the members in the 120-seat house being openly lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. This includes prominent leaders like Finance Minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay. The Greens surprisingly won as many as 10 seats in parliament.Newspaper headline: NZâ€™s next parliament most diverse
