Chileans voted overwhelmingly in a landmark referendum on Sunday to replace their constitution, long seen by many as underpinning the nation's glaring economic and social inequalities.

From today we must all work together so that the new constitution is the great framework of unity, stability and the future."The result comes as a slap in the face for Chile's political class, according to Marcelo Mella, a political scientist at the University of Santiago."Such a strong vote in favor of the constitutional convention should be read as a rejection of the political parties, which to a large extent have been administrators of [Augusto] Pinochet's constitution, of the regime we inherited from him," Mella told AFP. Within weeks, Pinera had agreed to initiate a process to draft a new constitution.
