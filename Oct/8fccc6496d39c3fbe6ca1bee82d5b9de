I am familiar with them, their lives and their works. I can even recite poems from poets like Li Bai, Tao Yuanming and Du Fu," he said. In front of the sculpture of Chinese poet Li Bai, the ambassador recited a line from the Tang Dynasty great's "A Tranquil Night" - "Looking up, I find the moon bright; Bowing, in homesickness I'm drowned."  The exhibition is scheduled to run until November 8.
