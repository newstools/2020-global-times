It denied any connection between the incident or the investigations and the university, but will conduct its own investigation to determine potential evidence of harm. The sudden death of Liu has triggered backlashes on China's social media platforms. With only vague information released by police about the case, the Chinese public is demanding to know the cause of Liu's death, and whether there is proof of the child pornography investigation. Some netizen are asking if Liu was a victim of US' political prosecution. "Even if the police have found conclusive evidence, they should proceed with a fair trial by the law, rather than announcing Liu's death with no explanations," one netizen wrote. "I request the US police disclose more details of the case. If there is any police violence or abuse of power during the investigation, they must be brought to justice," the comment read. The Confucius Institute, established around the world to enhance cultural and person-to-person exchanges between China and other countries and regions, has hit a bumpy road in recent years, with many people saying is the result of by mounting US hostility toward China. In early September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he was hopeful dozens of Confucius Institutes on the US campuses would be shut by the year end, accusing them of being "a propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party" on Twitter. Pompeo has labeled the Confucius Institute as a "foreign mission," a typical move of the Trump administration to ramp up its efforts to accelerate the decoupling from China.Global Times Newspaper headline: University seek details of Confucius Institute rep death
