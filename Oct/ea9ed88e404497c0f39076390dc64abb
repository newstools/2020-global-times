He spoke from a stage decorated with bales of hay and Halloween pumpkins."Donald Trump said, and is still saying, we're rounding the corner. It's going away. We're learning how to live with it." Biden said. "We're not learning how to live with it. You're asking us to learn how to die with it and it's wrong."The Biden campaign also deployed a key surrogate, former president Barack Obama, who slammed the Trump administration's COVID-19 response."The idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this thing up is nonsense," Obama told supporters at a drive-in rally in Miami, Florida."Donald Trump isn't suddenly going to protect all of us. He can't even take the basic steps to protect himself," Obama added, referring to Trump's hospitalization for COVID-19 three weeks ago.Also slamming the president's failure to denounce white supremacy, and the many times he has lied in public, among other issues, Obama called on supporters to vote for his former vice president.AFP
