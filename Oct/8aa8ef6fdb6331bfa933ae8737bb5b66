She's been the one protecting us from COVID-19," Goke noted.Suu Kyi has placed herself front and center of the nation's efforts to combat the pandemic, giving near daily addresses to implore citizens to follow lockdown measures.Experts say her decision to ignore calls for the vote to be postponed is a gamble.Her visibility has given the NLD an advantage, but watchdog International Crisis Group said turnout will likely be affected and there could be "serious public health ramifications."AFP
