However, since the outbreak and subsequent pandemic, Japan has faced rising economic pressure.Japan's economy shrank by 28.1 percent in April to June, compared with the same period last year, according to data from the Japanese government.Liu said that Japan hasn't "walked out of the shadow of deflation" yet, as the public's desire for consumption has slowed significantly due to the pandemic."If the government doesn't restart the economy, its impacts will be far-reaching," Liu noted.
