Touching something that is so old, you feel so in contact with the Earth," Italian Rossella Greco, 30, tells AFP, of the tour, which costs 10,000 kronur ($71).The bus' dimensions allow it to cross crevasses three meters wide, though also mean it guzzles 45 liters of petrol per kilometer and leaves deep tracks in the snow.However, the impact on the glacier "is small as long as it is just one or two vehicles," according to Thorsteinn Thorsteinsson, a glaciologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office.EndangeredAlong the path climbing from the foot of the Langjokull glacier, signs have been erected showing the ice line of every 20 years since 1940 - a reminder of how quickly the glacier is thinning.Nearly 250 square kilometers of surface area have evaporated since 1890 and the end of the Little Ice Age."The elevation of the glacier is getting lower in many, many places," Gunnar Gudjonsson, a tour guide of 20 years, told AFP."So it's actually new mountains or new nunataks [the ridge or summit of a mountain protruding from an ice field] coming out of the glaciers," he added."It's incredible how fast it is melting."In August, the dam of a glacial lake, formed by melt water, broke, causing flooding."It was not a major event but it happened in a region where we are not used to such phenomena," Thorsteinsson said.Powerful floods called jokulhaup are normal around the Vatnajokull glacier, the biggest in Iceland and also in Europe.These however are generally due to volcanic activity.But floods are bound to occur more regularly on glaciers elsewhere in Iceland, as global warming accelerates the melting.Langjokull's chances of survival are slim, Thorsteinsson warned."If this continues in a similar way or even in a still warmer climate, then it's very likely that all of Langjokull, or maybe 80 to 90 percent of it, will be gone by the end of this century," he said. Newspaper headline: Before it’s gone
