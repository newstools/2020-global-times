 China on Tuesday expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne's false accusations against China regarding freedom of religious belief, and gross interference in China's internal affairs on the so-called "International Religious Freedom Day" statement, according to the Chinese Embassy in Canada.The Chinese government protects citizens' freedom of religious belief in accordance with the law, and people of all ethnic groups, including Uygurs and Tibetans, enjoy full religious freedom in accordance with the law. Currently, there are nearly 200 million religious believers in China, more than 380,000 religious clerics, about 5,500 religious organizations, and more than 140,000 religious venues registered in accordance with the law, the embassy spokesperson said in a statement.China is a country ruled by law, and Chinese law will never allow anyone to engage in illegal and criminal activities under the guise of religion. Falun Gong is an anti-human, anti-society, and anti-science cult organization banned by the Chinese government in accordance with the law. The Canadian government has openly supported the organization, which is shocking, the embassy said.China urges Canada to respect basic facts, discard arrogance and prejudice, and stop using religious issues to interfere in China's internal affairs.
