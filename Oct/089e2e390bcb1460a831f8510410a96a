Early results from tests for a coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford, in collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc, show it produces a robust immune response in elderly people, the group at highest risk, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Monday.

A Syrian doctor gives seasonal flu vaccine to a medical worker at a hosptial in Damascus, capital of Syria, on October 21. The Health Ministry carried out a campaign to protect its workers from a possible second wave of COVID-19. Vaccinating seasonal influenza is necessary in order to avoid overlapping infections in winter.

But the FT cautioned that positive immunogenicity tests do not guarantee that the vaccine will ultimately prove safe and effective in older people.AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, is seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine to protect against COVID-19.Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, FT said, without naming a journal.Newspaper headline: Oxford vaccine tests good sign for elderly
