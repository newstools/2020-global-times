China will also roll out 27 reform measures and 40 prior authorization items for Shenzhen, Xi said."The President's remarks indicated the central government's high recognition of the Shenzhen model, offered a clear guideline and policy support for Shenzhen's future development path, injecting fresh momentum to the city, which is at the frontline of the China-US trade war," Liu Guohong, director at Department of Finance and Modern Industries under the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute, told the Global Times on Wednesday.As the ceremony also comes ahead of the fifth plenum of 19th CPC Central Committee, a key meeting that will chart China's economic and political direction for the next five years, Xi's words are not only an expectation for Shenzhen, but a hint of the country's future economic course - persisting in greater reform and opening-up no matter how complicated the external environment will be, experts said.

Shenzhen, dubbed as China's Silicon Valley, is home to a number of big-name Chinese tech giants, including Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, DJI, some of which have been targeted by the US."The President's comment is sending a clear signal that China's path [of opening-up] has yielded huge success. It also rebuts some Western world's prejudice and discrimination against China's path," a spokesperson of leading Shenzhen-based drone maker DJI surnamed Xie told the Global Times on Wednesday. Xie said that Chinese tech players in Shenzhen will be encouraged to do their best. "We have succeeded before, and the US attack won't stop or frighten us this time. We will strive to be a leading player in important tech fields," Xie noted.Prominent businesspeople including Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and representatives from all fields such as renowned respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan were among the audience. And representatives of people who have made great contributions to Shenzhen in the past four decades also spoke at the gathering on Wednesday. Chen Zhilie, founder and chairman of Evoc Intelligent Technology, shared how he developed his business career in Shenzhen over the past decades, and vowed to lead in special computer products sector.The Hong Kong-listed firm is primarily engaged in the research, development, manufacturing and distribution of special computer products, and the trading of electronic products and accessories."With entrepreneurship embedded in the Shenzhen spirit, we have every reason to believe that Shenzhen can counter the tech attack from the US, though we face extreme difficulties. A higher opening-up will only nurture the rise of new tech giants like Huawei and Tencent," Liu said.Shenzhen residents were also enthusiastic in welcoming Xi's visit and celebrating the 40th anniversary of the city's designation as a SEZ. "Today is a big day for Shenzhen. We're about to open a new chapter of development after four decades of reform and opening-up. But while we march forward, we will never forget how we got here," an excited local resident surnamed Zheng told the Global Times on Wednesday.In the main street in Qianhai of the city, flowers blossomed, and Chinese national flags and banners marking the 40th anniversary hung everywhere.In recent days, many visitors have been taking photos with the landmark stone in Qianhai, as Xi stood near the stone during his visit to Shenzhen in 2018. Lianhuashan Park, another landmark site in Shenzhen where the bronze statue of former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping - who spearheaded the reform and opening-up policy - was erected, also becomes a favorite of local residents in recent days. On Wednesday afternoon, Xi presented a flower basket to the statue of Deng Xiaoping at the park, expressing his deep respect for Deng.

In his speech, Xi extended a fresh welcome to foreign countries to participate more in the reform, opening-up and development of China's special economic zones.Foreign participation has been indispensable in the building of the special economic zones over the past 40 years, which in turn has also created vast development opportunities and offered development benefits to foreign countries, Xi said.More than 90,000 foreign-invested enterprises have been set up in Shenzhen since the city issued the first business license for a foreign-funded company in 1981. By the end of July, the city licensed over 94,000 foreign direct investment projects, with nearly $120 billion in foreign capital used since the establishment of SEZ, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Francine Hadjisotiriou, the General Manger of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China's South China Chapter, told the Global Times that European companies will keep a close eye on the implementation of detailed measures and how Shenzhen's path of "socialism with Chinese characteristics" will head the city in the coming years. "Since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 tour, southern China has been at the forefront of economic opening throughout the country," Hadjisotiriou said, noting that European companies are ready to deepen their positions in China, if given the right opportunities.She added that the growing input from European companies will facilitate China's industrial upgrade and promote the bilateral communication on cutting-edged high tech.
