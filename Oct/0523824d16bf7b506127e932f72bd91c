Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the country has not provoked any wars or military conflicts. China pursues a defensive national defense policy. China’s defense expenditure is also moderate and restrained, Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times.Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the third session of the 13th National People's Congress, had pointed out in May that from a global perspective, the proportion of China’s defense expenditure to GDP has remained at around 1.3 percent for many years, far below the world average of 2.6 percent. According to the Communiqué, with the aim of building a modern military as the centennial goal by 2027, China’s military will accelerate its integrated development in “mechanization,” “informatization” and “ntelligentization,” comprehensively strengthen military training and preparation. By then, the strategic ability to defend national sovereignty, security, and development interests will be largely improved, the Communiqué says.  The vision for the military to build up a strong force with such integrated capabilities means more intelligent weapons and equipment will be commissioned in the military to win future wars, analysts said, adding such goal will also be reached through drills closer to actual combat, military experts noted. The emphasis of intelligentializing the military doesn’t mean the military will give up basic mechanized weaponry, but to modernize it to be more intelligent,” Li said, citing an example that a smart unmanned submarine is able to make decisions on its own, from cruise to detecting and capturing targets.Smart aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships and large destroyers are also viewed as key items and weaponry in protecting China’s interests and security.Song said China’s military system reform is also part of the centennial goal.
