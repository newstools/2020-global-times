The officer, who is Hispanic and has not been named, has since been fired.Police have said that another officer first tried to investigate what appeared to be a suspicious car, but the couple fled.The second officer then intervened, but the vehicle allegedly backed toward him and he opened fire.Williams has said that she was smoking a cigarette in the car, which was parked in front of her home, with Stinette when the first officer approached.AFP
