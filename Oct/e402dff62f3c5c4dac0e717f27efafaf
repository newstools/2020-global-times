In Chinese, se means color but also erotic. For Xiu, the idiom becomes a pun used to describe his interest in color. The exhibition displays ancient objects that have changed color due to oxidation. A candlestick monkey statuette made using traditional copper gilding techniques is one highlight of the exhibition. Over the years such ancient objects turned from its original color to show green and black marks, which in the collector’s eyes that such colors are the brightest, and show the beauty of being imperfect.
