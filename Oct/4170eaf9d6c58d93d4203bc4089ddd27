The province reported more than 1,000 new infections for the eighth time in nine days.The provincial government called on Quebecers to make sacrifices and avoid socializing over the long weekend.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Friday that the country is "at a tipping point in this pandemic" as he released new projections that suggested the death toll in Canada could reach 9,800 by the end of next week, a situation he said requires immediate efforts by Canadians to curtail outings and gatherings.
