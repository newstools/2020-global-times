Cheng Ke (pseudonym), a doctor from a township hospital near Mianyang, Southwest China's Sichuan Province said that since the COVID-19 outbreak, the hospital's infection control department has conducted inspections across the hospital more often than before, nearly once a week. "A hospital is the last defense when fighting contagious diseases, so we have to make sure the hospital is clean," Cheng said.She also said the hospital has arranged more training opportunities for its doctors this year, even sending them to study in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, to narrow the gap between village hospitals and those in big cities.Another shortcoming of China's public health system is the reporting and warning system, Zeng pointed out, urging health institutes to report suspicious cases and samples within the already established warning system, instead of bypassing it.China built a direct reporting system on infectious diseases after the SARS outbreak in 2003, which was also supposed to provide early warning on infectious diseases. But it was widely believed to have failed during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan.Wang, who is among the first batch of medical experts to Wuhan in January, said that grassroots medical employees are used to reporting contagious diseases, such as the bird flu. Hopefully, after lessons drawn from COVID-19, the warning system will play a bigger role in the future, and government and medical employees will be more transparent when facing suspicious diseases.  "Let science prevail," Wang said.Yet, experts are confident that in the wake of two epidemics, SARS and COVID-19, and given the fact that China is now giving unprecedented attention to its public health system, the country will manage to build more comprehensive and advanced ones in the next five years.
