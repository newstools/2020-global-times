The national flag shall not be arbitrarily discarded.According to the new law, those who intentionally insult the national flag or national emblem by burning, mutilating, painting, defacing, or trampling them in public places shall be prosecuted for criminal responsibility. For less serious cases, the offender will be detained for no more than 15 days by a public security organ.The new law is believed to be a deterrent to those who desecrated the national flag and emblem during the anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in 2019. Rioters who removed a Chinese national flag from a flagpole at Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor and tossed it into the Harbor during a protest in August 2019 – a move that tarnished the country's dignity – were strongly condemned by the HKSAR government and the Chinese people.The amendment also expands the scope for displaying the national flag and emblem. For instance, it stipulates official institutions of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR and Macao Special Administrative Region shall display the national flag and the national emblem on weekdays.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
