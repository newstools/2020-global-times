A Hindu priest stands in front of a fire at the Baramahini Temple during the 10th day of Dashain festival in Bhaktapur, Nepal on Monday. Dashain celebrations include processions to a river or ocean front that involve carrying clay statues of Hindu gods and goddesses, accompanied by music and chants, after which the images are immersed in the water for dissolution and farewell.
