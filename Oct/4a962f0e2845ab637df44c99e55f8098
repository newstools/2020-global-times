People wave Italian flags as they protest against the government restriction measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Rome on Tuesday. Photo: AFPItalian police fired teargas at demonstrators protesting virus restrictions on Tuesday for the second night running, as dire figures on global tourism and investment highlighted the devastating economic impact of the pandemic. Thousands protested again in Italian cities with the cry of "freedom" punctuated by clashes with police, with many traders and employees fearing a second wave economic slump as much as the rising virus numbers.The protesters are upset at the mandatory early closure of restaurants and other businesses. Some of the rallies have turned violent, particularly in Milan and Turin on Monday night.Late on Tuesday, the Italian government announced the release of five billion euros ($5.9 billion dollars) of funding for the worst hit professions.However, unhappiness over the measures in Italy and elsewhere in Europe - once again the global epicenter of the pandemic - is palpable among the business owners and residents who are once again facing lengthy restrictions as economies struggle to recover.The United Nations, which is battling its own outbreak, forcing it to halt all face-to-face meetings at its New York headquarters, published a slew of data laying bare the travails of the global economy.While the World Tourism Organization said tourism had collapsed by 70 percent this year leading to a $730-billion loss in revenues, the UN's trade body UNCTAD said foreign direct investment flows had fallen 49 percent.The grim economic outlook was compounded by continuing spikes in virus cases across Europe and beyond.Worldwide more than 1.1 million have died from the virus since it emerged in late 2019.AFP
