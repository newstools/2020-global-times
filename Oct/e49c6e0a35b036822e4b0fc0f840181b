"Details of when and how the vaccines will be distributed to [the vaccination sites] across the city are still being worked out," said a staffer with the local CDC.Those engaged in relatively high-risk jobs, including medical and epidemic prevention workers, port inspectors and public service personnel, are among the priority groups being offered the shots.However, ordinary citizens with the need for vaccine injection for urgent use could also make a reservation at community-level vaccination sites once the priority groups have been accounted for, said the Jiaxing CDC.Several local vaccination sites reached by the Global Times on Friday said they have been informed of the matter, but are yet to receive the COVID-19 vaccines."I have no idea when and how many vaccines we will have," said Zhao, a staffer with Xinjia community healthcare center, who added that the center had received lots of inquiries from local residents about the injections.Zhao estimated that ordinary citizens won't able to be vaccinated in the near future as priority would still be given to the high-risk groups.According to Jiaxing CDC, citizens must "weigh the advantages and disadvantages of getting COVID-19 vaccine shots for urgent use" and sign an informed consent form before receiving the shots voluntarily.This vaccine type contains two doses at an interval of 14-28 days, said the CDC.
