The three sections – Fluid Society, Natural Simulation and the Deduction of Civilization – show how artists create art to reflect social issues, explore the uncertainties between the natural and the artificial, and discover the elements that construct the concept of civilization in an artistic context. The virtual showroom displays Eilisa’s AI world and explores the existence of time. First launched in 2011, the Art Nova 100 program is dedicated to recommending and supporting young artists. The 2020 Art Nova 100 exhibition is scheduled to end on Saturday.
