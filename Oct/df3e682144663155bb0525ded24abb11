Meanwhile, it projected China's economy to grow by 1.9 percent this year, 0.9 percentage point above its June forecast."When we look at the more disaggregated data, the manufacturing sector is doing better, whereas the services, especially contact services, are still more constraint," said the IMF chief.

"I cannot stress enough how important it is that boost the confidence that we together can get out of this crisis," said the IMF chief.In an interview with Xinhua earlier this week, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said "the importance of multilateralism has never been greater.""With this pandemic, unless we're able to control it everywhere in the world, nowhere in the world will be safe, and so countries have to work together," Gopinath said.
