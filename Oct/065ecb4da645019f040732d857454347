Sharks can get amputated especially the fins during untangling from fishing nets," said the report.Mafia Island, located 20 kilometers offshore from the eastern extent of the Rufiji delta on the southern coast of Tanzania, is the only home for the whale sharks in the east African nation.Whale sharks are protected and listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of endangered, threatened and protected species.
