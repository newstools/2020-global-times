Promoting the education of the awareness of the Chinese nation's community in a normalized and long-term way," Shi said. "This meeting was a reflection into Inner Mongolia's bilingual education reform, and a way to push forward the strengthening and improvement the ethnic work in the region."The Inner Mongolia government in August released new education regulations that said students entering the first grade in ethnic primary and middle schools will use unified national textbooks for Chinese language and literature and their courses would be taught in the national common spoken and written language.The new regulation raised concerns from some parents, who were misled by rumors that the new regulation would replace the Mongolian language with the Putonghua, the national common spoken and written language, and that the new policy would make it harder for ethnic minority students to get into college.But later the local government of Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia issued a detailed explanation, guaranteeing that the new regulation doesn't signal a cancellation of classes taught in the Mongolian language, nor does it mean the end of preferable policies aimed at helping ethnic minority students get into college.https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1200088.shtmlGlobal Times
