Boeing says the missile uses GPS-aided inertial navigation and delivers a 500-pound blast warhead. It can target coastal defense sites, surface-to-air missile sites, exposed aircraft, ships in port, and port and industrial facilities, the AP reported.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday that "the US missiles could bring some threats to the PLA if war breaks out between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, so this is more proof that the US has violated its promise made in the three joint communiques with the People's Republic of China to gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan."Just as US national security adviser Robert O'Brien suggested to the island's secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority, the US is trying to make the island weaponized like a "porcupine" with some offensive US-made weapons so that the Chinese mainland will not risk bringing back Taiwan with force if necessary, said mainland experts. "The threat that these Harpoon missiles poses to the PLA is very limited, as they are high subsonic missiles designed in the 1980s, and the current self-defense and anti-missile facilities installed by the PLA on its vessels and land-based bases can shoot them down easily," Song said.The US has a more advanced anti-ship missile with stealth capability, but it won't sell it to Taiwan, so the latest announced sale is another expensive deal aimed at taking Taiwan taxpayers' money with low-quality weapons, in other words, the US is still treating the island as a "cash machine," Song further said. He noted that similar missiles, like the Hsiung Feng III developed by Taiwan's own defense industrial institute, will be abandoned by the Taiwan authorities due to this arms sale. Some Taiwan-based observers said if Democratic candidate Joe Biden, who has less connections with the secessionist DPP authority, wins the US presidential election, the planned US arms sale to the island might be impacted.  But mainland experts said regardless of whether Donald Trump or Biden wins the election next week, it is unlikely the US will make any change to the deal, as both Republicans and Democrats share a consensus in the Congress on arms sales to Taiwan. Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US may make some adjustments to its China policy if Trump fails to get reelected, but before the formal power transition in January 2021, the Trump administration could make more extreme and offensive moves, which "China will not tolerate." Due to the Cold War mentality that drives US policymakers to contain China and the huge profits brought by arms sales, the US Congress has already passed a series of acts in recent years authorizing the US government to normalize arms sales to Taiwan, despite the fact these acts are illegal under international law as they damage China's sovereignty, so even if Biden and the Democrats gain power, the US will still sell weapons to Taiwan, Song said. Sanctions for deterrenceChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian announced at a routine press conference on Monday that China would sanction US firms including Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, Raytheon as well as individuals and entities that are involved in arms sales to the island of Taiwan. The sanctions came in response to recently approved US arms sales to Taiwan on October 21, which could have a total value of $1.81 billion, Zhao said.All of these US firms have direct or indirect businesses in the Chinese mainland, so the sanctions will close the door on the most stable and profitable markets to these companies, and this is the price they must pay for interfering in the Taiwan question, said Chinese mainland experts. Whether this move can deter their acts or not, the mainland must go through with it to demonstrate its determination in safeguarding its core interests and sovereignty, experts said."For instance, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, owned by Lockheed Martin, has cooperation with China on helicopters for civilian use, and Lockheed Martin also has interests in some nuclear power projects in China. Raytheon and its subsidiaries do business in China in the automobile industry. Boeing has broader cooperation with China on airliners," said Song, noting that these businesses could all be impacted.Song said the sanctions announced by the Chinese mainland is a sign to other US firms and companies from other countries enjoying profits from the mainland market. "Those three US firms are an example of what will happen if they dare to put their hands on arms sales to Taiwan."
