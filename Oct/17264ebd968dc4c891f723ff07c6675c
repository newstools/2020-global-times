Huawei has been stocking banned items such as chips to create a buffer zone from the US ban.Huawei said it looks to tap the development and deployment of 5G wireless telecommunication technology in the next phase.Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
