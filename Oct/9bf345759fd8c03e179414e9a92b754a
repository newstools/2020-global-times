(which) insists on implementing its systematic policy against our territories by allowing settlers to attack farmers and lands," Laban told Xinhua.The annual olive harvest season generates an estimated income of 800 million U.S. dollars to 900 million dollars for the Palestinian agricultural sector, contributing 20 to 25 percent of the total Palestinian economy.
