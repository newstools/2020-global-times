The IMF said that China is an important contributor to this trend.China's exports jumped 10.2 percent year-on-year to 5 trillion yuan ($742 billion) in the third quarter while imports were up 4.3 percent to 3.88 trillion yuan, data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday.In the report, the IMF forecast that the global economy will contract 4.4 percent in 2020, which is a less severe contraction than forecast in its last report, because activity began to improve sooner than expected after lockdowns in advanced economies were scaled back in May and June.Yet, the IMF warned that the world economy's long ascent back to pre-pandemic levels of activity "remains prone to setbacks." It forecast that the US economy would contract 5.8 percent this year, Germany would shrink 6.0 percent and India 10.3 percent.
