"This Taiwan plane did not report its flight route, so it was forced to return.""It reflects the one-China principle," Song said. The one-China principle could be implemented in many ways, such as issues on the "middle line" of the Taiwan Straits, and the air control regions."Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. The Hong Kong-Taiwan relation is under the direction of the Chinese central government. It is justified for Hong Kong to reject the Taiwan island's flight," Zhang Wensheng, a deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Zhang added that when cross-Straits relations were more moderate, there would usually be tacit agreements between military aircraft from the two sides, as flying to Dongsha or Kinmen, Taiwan flights can hardly avoid entering the mainland's FIR. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, most countries or regions divide the airspace under their jurisdiction into several flight information regions, including the airspace above the adjacent high seas.The United Daily News said that the charter flight brings members of sea patrol and defense departments of Taiwan, and runs regularly between the island of Taiwan and Dongsha islands.
