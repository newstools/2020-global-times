The number of patent filings per 10,000 people was to increase from 6.3 to 12, while the contribution of sci-tech advances to economic growth was expected to jump to 60 percent from 55.3 percent. The plan also set targets for internet penetration: fixed broadband penetration among Chinese households to hit 70 percent from 40 percent, and the penetration of mobile broadband among users to reach 85 percent from 57 percent.The internet penetration targets have been overshot. As of the end of last year, the fixed broadband penetration rate among households had hit 91 percent, while the mobile broadband penetration rate had clocked in at 96 percent, Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology Wang Zhijun revealed at a press conference last week.Global Times
