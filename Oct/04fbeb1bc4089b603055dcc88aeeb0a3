We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigations," Meadows said, comparing the deadlier COVID-19 to the seasonal flu.Asked about Meadows' comments, Tedros said he agreed that focusing on mitigation, and especially on protecting the vulnerable, was important."But giving up on control is dangerous," he insisted.Tedros stressed that mitigation and controlling the pandemic were "not contradictory. We can do both."While governments have a responsibility to ensure things like testing and contact tracing, he emphasized that everyone had a responsibility to halt the spread of COVID-19."Governments should do their share and our citizens should do their share, to do everything to minimize transmission," he said. "There aren't magic solutions to this outbreak." "No one wants more so-called lockdowns. But if we want to avoid them, we all have to play our part."  When asked about Meadows' comments, WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan also said countries should "not give up on trying to suppress transmission." AFP
