Photo: Zhang JianjunExhibits and visitors from overseas attending the 3rd China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, which will be held from November 5 to 10, will enjoy a swift border inspection when passing through Shanghai's entry ports. To ensure the quick unload of exhibits upon their arrival by ship, exhibits arriving by sea can receive a pre-inspection by the Shanghai General Station of Immigration Inspection via the online channel before their arrival, the Shanghai border inspection authority said.When the ship arrives at the port, China's border inspection police will board the ship as soon as possible and complete their inspection.The authority will learn in advance the trajectory of the ship and the schedules of its crew members before they enter the country, and screen for personnel with travel or residence histories in high-risk countries based on big data technologies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.For inbound cargo planes carrying CIIE exhibits, a special inspection team has been established at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport to work 24 hours a day to ensure the rapid customs clearance of important exhibits.In addition, 14 designated immigration-inspection channels have been opened at the Pudong airport to ensure a rapid and smooth border clearance of delegates participating in the CIIE, the authority said.
