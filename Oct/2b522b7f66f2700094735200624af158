Around 100,000 dormant accounts reportedly held deposits worth more than £1,000.The exposure, along with earlier scandals that HSBC had been involved in, aroused doubts among experts about the bank’s internal management. The HSBC has been earlier accused of being an accomplice of the US government to trap Huawei, resulting in the arrest of the company’s CFO Meng Wanzhou. The incident largely hurt the bank’s reputation in China, although the company denied playing a role in the arrest of Meng.  “Such incidents show that HSBC’s internal management is ‘in chaos’ by repeatedly tramping on the interests of its customers,” Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times. Global Times Year of the Rat stampSpectators dazzled at 131st Rose ParadeDiving Santa Global Times and Pakistan Observer signs MoUThe 3rd Sino-Nordic Cup Football Tournament draws crowdsGlobal Times begins cooperation with Sputnik
