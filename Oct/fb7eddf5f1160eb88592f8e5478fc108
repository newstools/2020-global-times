As various military services hasten their joint powers, China will become more powerful in safeguarding the islands, reefs and maritime rights and interests, Li told the Global Times. Since an organizational adjustment three years ago, Marine Corps troops have undergone unprecedented tests in all types of terrain in fast-paced, highly intensive combat exercises, and these operations show the Marines have turned from an amphibious to a multidimensional force, the PLA Daily reported in May.The operations include: the exercises simulated helicopter landings on a pirate ship in the South China Sea, fast boat landings on a hijacked ship in the Gulf of Aden, tropical island seizing missions with amphibious assault vehicles, infiltration missions in extremely cold grasslands, shooting training in Djibouti and competing in the International Army Games 2019 in Russia.Xi gave full recognition to the Marine Corps on the construction, development and task fulfillment since its reorganization and establishment in 2017, after watching training videos of relevant task teams during his inspection.   Xi stressed the need to strengthen strategic design for the construction of the Marine Corps.The strategic design should fit with the country's strategies of national development, security and military, strategic arrangements of modernized national defense and military, as well as the construction of the joint operations systems and transformation of the navy, Xi said. China has been regularly sending naval escort task groups to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia and operates a support base in Djibouti, and chances for Marine Corps activities overseas will continue to increase, said Li.Xi also said the corps should not reduce vigilance in epidemic prevention and control against the COVID-19, as the epidemic situation still remains uncertain, and the corps should take multiple measures to push forward the construction of the troops.Global Times
