 "The rather positive remark from Washington showed that the US still very much wants to move forward with the deal and that, under its current economic hardship, it needs the deal more than ever," Huo Jianguo, vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.Huo said that the US' positive attitude is in line with that of the Chinese side, which has made it clear that it would carry out the agreement. "With both sides committed, I think it's likely we will see purchases of US products increase significantly in the remaining months of the year," he said.The USTR-USDA joint statement came just days after senior Chinese officials, in meetings with leaders of the US-China Business Council, reiterated that China was willing to work with the US to overcome challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to jointly implement the trade deal.With a solid recovery in the economy, which saw an impressive 4.9-percent expansion in the third quarter, and the opening of the CIIE, major deals for the purchase of US agricultural and other products could be expected, experts said."That's in line with rising demand in the domestic market," Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerce's International Market Research Institute, told the Global Times on Sunday, adding that it's "very likely we will see some major deals" at the CIIE.More than 150 US companies have been confirmed to attend the CIIE, scheduled for November 5-10 in Shanghai, including 3M, Qualcomm Technologies, Pfizer and Exxon Mobil Corp, according to media reports.Zhang Xiaoping, country director for China at the US Soybean Export Council, told the Global Times that the US soybean industry would also attend the CIIE. "Though the exhibiting area would be slightly smaller, there will be more products [on display] because some member companies will attend," Zhang said.
