"The country used to stress economic growth driven by exports, government-led investment, innovation and consumption, but the new strategy is more precise and inclusive to resolve new problems emerging in our development," he said.Under a "dual circulation" strategy, technological innovation will drive China's manufacturing industry and push it up the global value chain while strategically ensuring domestic supply, experts noted. Achieving independence in key areas, such as scientific research and finance, is expected to be a focus."Technologies relevant to semiconductors, 5G and quantum computing, among others will be likely mentioned in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Policy support involving taxes support and talent nurturing will surely be included," Li Chang'an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics' School of Public Administration, told the Global Times on Friday.Flexible planningExperts said that planning for the next five years should be flexible enough to swiftly respond to uncertainties brought about by a variety of factors.The formulation of the 14th Five-Year Plan comes at a critical time with increasing risk of decoupling with the US. China has to draw up plans to address challenges in the economy, diplomacy and industrial development in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that has seen the worst global recession in decades and has impacted supply chains and demand worldwide.Analysts said supply-side structural reforms, and reforms governing population migration and fostering people's income will draw policymakers' attention.

He projected that China may set an annual GDP growth target of 4-5 percent for 2021-25.During the first four years of the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), China maintained GDP growth of 6.6 percent, slightly higher than the target of 6.5 percent. Despite the tremendous shock of the global pandemic, the resilient Chinese economy is the first major economy to post positive growth this year, growing 0.7 percent year-on-year in the first three quarters.Cao said the country will conduct more reforms over the next five years to release huge domestic economic potential. After achieving the goals of securing a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects as well as winning the fight against poverty which is soon to be realized, China will further narrow residents' income gap and improve its social security system.By 2022 China is expected to enter the threshold of "high-income countries" as classified by the World Bank.
