The crackdown might deal a blow to Ant Group's upcoming dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong, the report said.With the nation pushing for domestically developed blockchain technology, it'll be increasingly the case that local companies won't have to worry about such threats, Lin said. The use of US technologies could put the data security of local blockchain firms at stake, he said, and that's why his company spent two and a half years and tens of millions of yuan to carve out its own blockchain system. Holding a bullish attitude toward China's digital economy, Lin disclosed that the company, valued at more than 1 billion yuan, also has plans to foray into digital-asset transactions, which would include carbon emissions trading. The vision depends on the government easing license requirements for digital-asset trading, he said.The size of China's digital economy is still not in the same league as the US, but China outshines the US in e-commerce and mobile payments, according to a report by China International Capital Corp (CICC) in September. China's mobile payment market totaled $414 billion in 2018, while the marketplace for mobile payments was only worth $64 billion in the US, read the CICC report, noting that China holds an edge on the commercial applications of the digital economy, in that the nation has more application scenarios, a huge market and fewer obstacles to innovation.In a sign of vibrancy of the nation's digital economy, Fujian, the summit's host, announced on Tuesday that the province has facilitated the signing of 426 digital economy-related projects, involving an investment of 331.6 billion yuan, while 181 projects are being negotiated, involving investments totaling 107.6 billion yuan.
