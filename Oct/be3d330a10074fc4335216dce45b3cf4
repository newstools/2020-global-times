British lawmakers called on Monday for urgent government action to support 1.5 million women with endometriosis - a debilitating condition that can lead to absenteeism from school and work and infertility.

Symptoms include extremely painful periods, chronic pelvic pain and painful intercourse and bowel movements. But average diagnosis times in Britain take eight years and have not improved in a decade, according to an inquiry by a cross-party panel of lawmakers in which more than 10,000 people participated.Girls and women told how the "invisible illness" impacted their work, social life, relationships and mental health with some failing exams or having to quit their jobs. But when they went to the doctor they were often disbelieved, dismissed or even advised to have a baby."Action is needed now, to ensure the next generation with endometriosis are not robbed of the future they deserve," said Emma Cox, chief executive of the charity Endometriosis UK.The lawmakers called for the government to invest in research to find the cause of endometriosis, better treatments and an eventual cure. Investment in research was tiny compared to that for conditions like diabetes which had similar prevalence rates.Newspaper headline: Lawmakers urge action to help 1.5m women in UK
