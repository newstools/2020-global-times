Satellite images show the number of large methane leaks from the oil and gas industry rose by nearly a third in the first eight months of 2020 to over 5,000, despite the sector's pledges to reduce greenhouse emissions, data firm Kayrros said.

"Such increases in methane emissions are concerning and in stark contradiction to the direction set in the Paris Agreement of 2015 [to keep global warming below 1.5 C].""In 2019 alone, our technology tracked a combined volume of visible large methane leaks of 10 million tons, equivalent to over 800 million tons of CO2 over a 20-year period."In 2019, the largest emitters were the US, Russia, Algeria, Turkmenistan, Iran and Iraq, Rostand said.Pledges to reduce methane leaks are more prevalent among listed producers such as BP and Exxon than at national oil companies. Kayrros' research is part of a growing effort in recent months by data companies, academics and some energy producers to use technology to find the biggest methane leaks. The European Union, the world's biggest gas importer, is considering binding methane emissions standards for the natural gas it buys, it said on Wednesday.
