(Xinhua/Xu Jinquan)Â The Trump administration's appeal against a previous WTO ruling on China tariffs has no significance due to the fact that the Appellate Body has already become dysfunctional thanks to the US' previous efforts to hobble it, experts told the Global Times on Tuesday.As Washington turns to the same multilateral trade system it has railed against for years, China should in fact welcome the move, knowing that the WTO's decision will be fair and objective, and that the US will lose the appeal, they continued.The remarks come after Bloomberg reported on Monday that the Trump administration had appealed a WTO dispute ruling that said American tariffs on more than $234 billion of Chinese exports violated international rules.Meanwhile, the Trump administration defended its tariff strategy and said the ruling will have no bearing on the phase-one trade agreement with China, according to the report."Such an appeal is brazen and frankly a slap in the face, since the WTO's dispute settlement system has been paralyzed as a result of the US' years of complaint," Tu Xinquan, president of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Tuesday."It means the appeal won't be reviewed anytime soon, and might leave the case unresolved for a long time," Tu said.WTO's Appellate Body is an appeals court presided over by seven judges appointed by the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. In September, a panel of WTO experts ruled that the US tariffs imposed on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese products under the country's Section 301 Domestic Trade Act violated global trade regulations, offering a big win to China and a major blow to the US government."In light of its conclusion that the United States has not adequately explained how the measures chosen by it are necessary to protect public morals, the United States has not met its burden of demonstrating that the measures are provisionally justified," the WTO panel said in a statement.Sang Baichuan, an economics professor at the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US' move to appeal showed the US' extreme egoism: when it thought WTO's system and rules 'harmed' its interests, it crippled the organization; but now that the system has become its only chance to appeal, it's clinging on to it tightly."China should have confidence that the WTO will offer fair and objective rules after the US appeal. And we have reason to believe that the US will lose the appeal," said Sang.China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement following September's WTO ruling that China always respects the WTO's rulings and also hopes the US can respect the expert panel's ruling, as well as take concrete actions to meet China and other WTO members halfway to preserve the multilateral trade system.
