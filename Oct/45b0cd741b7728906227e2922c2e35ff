Yoshihide Suga Photo: VCGUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions in Japan to net zero by 2050.During a 10-minute telephone conversation between the pair, Suga informed Guterres that Japan will join the Climate Ambition Alliance, a consortium of countries, cities, companies and official bodies committed to achieving carbon neutral targets, the Foreign Ministry here said.Suga's talks with Guterres followed his first policy speech in parliament a day earlier since taking office last month, during which he said that Japan would now aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, compared to the previous administration's plans of reducing emissions by 80 percent by 2050.He said that proactive measures and a change of mindset would be necessary to achieve the goal."We need to change our mindset and proactively take measures against global warming that will bring about changes to industrial structures, as well as the economy and society, and lead to major growth," the Japanese premiere said.He went on to say this could be achieved by the enhanced use of renewable and nuclear energy.Suga's pledge follows China announcing at the UN General Assembly last month its much-hailed target of becoming carbon-neutral by 2060.Suga added Tuesday that Japan will expedite the process of creating a "virtuous cycle of environment and economic growth through innovations and continue to play an active role in realizing a carbon free society sought by the Paris accord," the ministry said.In response, Guterres was quoted as expressing his gratitude and saying he was encouraged by Japan's leadership.The UN chief's spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement before the telephone talks that Japan's commitment to achieving the emissions goal is a "very significant positive development."Guterres has "no doubt that Japan has all the necessary technological, financial and engineering tools to get to net zero emissions by 2050," and is "confident that Japan will also assist developing countries to reach that same objective," said the statement.
