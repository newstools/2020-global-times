He projected that China's retail sales growth may rebound to 8 percent next year, while its GDP growth may reach as much as 10 percent, given the low base this year.New business models such as online learning, internet health and live-streaming sales will lead China's consumption to swiftly expand, he said.Newspaper headline: Spending recovers from virus
