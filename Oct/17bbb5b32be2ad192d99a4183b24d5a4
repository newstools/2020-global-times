The US State Department has suspended all training programs for employees related to diversity and inclusion, an internal cable obtained by Reuters showed, after President Donald Trump directed federal agencies in September to end programs deemed divisive by the White House.

"They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place."Biden, who has accused Trump of racism, leads by 8 percentage points nationally, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 51 percent of likely voters say they are backing the Democratic challenger while 43 percent are voting for the president.At the pair's second debate, on Thursday, Trump denied the accusations and said he was least racist person in the room.With its 76,000 employees globally and representing the face of the US  in the world, the State Department has had a mixed track record on diversity, with racial and ethnic minorities still underrepresented, particularly in senior ranks, according to an independent federal watchdog report released earlier in 2020. "Long-standing diversity issues persist," concluded the report from the US Government Accountability Office.Newspaper headline: Trump defends suspension
