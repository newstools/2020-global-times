"In that case, Trump finishing his medical quarantine and resuming public events are anti-science actions," Diao noted. Diao said that Trump is acting like a "trapped beast fighting desperately" at the risk of his own life and public safety."States that Trump is scheduled to go for his campaign, including Florida and Iowa, are crucial for him, and if he could not win these states, he will fail," Diao noted.Democratic nominee Joe Biden appears to be leading Trump among likely voters in Florida and the two are locked in a tight race in Arizona, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls released on Wednesday. While the presidential election is approaching, the COVID-19 outbreak at the White House seems to be out of control.US media outlet ABC News reported on Thursday that the novel coronavirus has infected "34 White House staffers and other contacts" in recent days, an indication that the disease has spread among more people than previously known in the seat of US government."A total of 377 employees work at the White House, of whom 34 staffers and contacts have been infected, almost one-tenth, what a big shock!" Diao said, noting that the White House is at high risk of infection.The White House and even Washington itself have turned into a "virus den" which could usher in another wave of outbreak among more officials at other national authorities and their contacts, analysts said.Shen Yi, a professor at Shanghai-based Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday that the "superspreader event" is a "magic realism show", reflecting US politicians' neglect of a public health emergency at the risk of their safety. "If the outbreak further spreads among them, government work would be paralyzed, and they will reap what they have sown," Shen said."The highlight of the presidential election actually is how high a price America will have to pay to complete this transition of power," Shen said.He noted that the "morbid" move by Trump for political gains and the long-lasting partisan war in the US amid the COVID-19 epidemic, have "dumbfounded the world," and this year's presidential election is no end to the US-style "magic realism show."
