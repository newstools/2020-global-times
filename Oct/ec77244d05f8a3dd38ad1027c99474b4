Some [US] politicians are trying to restart the 'Cold War,' coercing other countries to join the anti-China camp to interrupt China's development process," Li said. On June 29, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a phone call with Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen. In September, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper spoke with Bangladesh Prime Minister  and Minister of Defense Sheikh Hasina over the phone, clearly proposing to strengthen US-Bangladesh defense cooperation.In mid-October, US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun visited Bangladesh and held meetings with Prime Minister Hasina and other key government officials, attempting to sell the "Indo-Pacific strategy" to Bangladesh. "These meetings show the US has made continuous moves with ulterior motives," Li said."I want to emphasize that China has the wisdom and ability to escape the so-called 'Thucydides Trap' and urge some anti-China politicians in the US to abandon their outdated Cold War mentality and zero-sum game," the ambassador stressed. The US will eventually have more people of insight who can correctly view China and China-US relations, and push bilateral relations back to the right track of coordination, cooperation, and stability and actively contributing to global development, he noted.
