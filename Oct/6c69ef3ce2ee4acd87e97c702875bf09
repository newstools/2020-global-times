One day before O'Brien's speech, David Helvey, the US principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said Taiwan's intention to boost defense spending by $1.4 billion next year was insufficient.Taiwan needs to buy a large number of small lethal capability weapons, such as coastal defense cruise missiles, and spend intelligently in its development of indigenous weapons to defend itself, Helvey claimed. Yet it would be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. No matter how many weapons Taiwan buys from the US, the island lags too far behind the mainland in military capacity, according to Li Jie.
