Britain has banned sexual relations between government staff giving aid and people receiving it, as lawmakers seek to stamp out abuse in the aid sector following a string of sex scandals.

The UN and NGOs have vowed to crack down on abuses but claims continue to emerge.The FCDO letter was written in response to concerns raised by parliament's International Development Committee in October that a new government strategy only "strongly discouraged," rather than prohibited, staff from sex with aid beneficiaries. Parliament opened an inquiry into sexual abuse in the aid sector in 2018 after reports emerged that former staff of Oxfam, one of Britain's biggest charities, paid for sex in Haiti while on a mission to help those affected by a 2010 earthquake."It's become apparent in our inquiry on sexual exploitation and abuse in the aid sector that too many beneficiaries are being taken advantage of by those in trusted positions," said Sarah Champion, International Development Committee chairwoman. The International Development Committee is now seeking to clarify whether the policy extends to other government departments, Champion said.
