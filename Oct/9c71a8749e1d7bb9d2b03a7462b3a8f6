US President Donald Trump addressed supporters from a White House balcony on Saturday, his first public appearance since he tested positive for COVID-19 on October 1. The White House sent out 2,000 invitations out but only few hundred people attended the event, according to US media.

[But] if you get it in the form of natural immunity, that isn't known yet," Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer told CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday."If you get it in our vial, if you will, that's probably going to last you for months," he said.Badly trailing Biden with just weeks until the November 3 vote, Trump has been counting the days until he can hit the trail again.The Republican leader rallied hundreds of supporters for a comeback event at the White House on Saturday, and is planning back-to-back rallies this week - in Florida on Monday, then Pennsylvania and Iowa - in a bid to salvage his struggling campaign.AFP
