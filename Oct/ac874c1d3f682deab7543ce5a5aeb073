It is also preparing the HSK (written test) and HSKK (oral test) exams to certify Chinese language proficiency."We put together this battery of courses. Teachers from China and teachers from Cordoba devised the syllabus together. We decorated the classrooms, and we opened with a very good enrollment. There are 150 students who are taking 11 classes. The first one ended on September 30 and now we are registering a new course for level zero [introductory]," said Perez. During a virtual opening ceremony on Friday, UNC rector Hugo Juri said the new institute aims to promote "an East-West corridor of fruitful exchange that contributes to scientific cooperation and the solution of problems common to both nations."The institute will form part of the university's north campus, where a technology park is currently under development. In 2021, the university's publishing house will launch a collection of China-themed publications.Future plans also include a course to teach the Chinese language to young girls and boys through "children's rhymes, calligraphy, paper-cutting techniques and the spelling of one's own name," said Perez.Professors from other Chinese educational institutions have joined the activities of the UNC Confucius Institute, teaching classes on Chinese literature and politics, she said."Language is the most elementary of gestures people can exchange, in addition to hugs, in addition to gestures of cordiality and courtesy. In addition to offering a plate of food, to speak another's language is to show great interest in them," said Perez.  Newspaper headline: East-West corridor
