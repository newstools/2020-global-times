Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry Photo: VCG Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin Tuesday slammed the New York Post article by Kelly Craft, US envoy to the United Nations (UN), saying that it shows once again US politicians' ignorance and prejudice.Wang made the remarks during a routine press conference on Tuesday, responding to a question on Craft's article published in the New York Post on October 21, in which she attacked China's cooperation with the UN and claimed the current US administration is "an administration retreating from multilateralism," but "is doing the hard work necessary to fix and preserve a multilateral system."As a nation that holds a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and the second largest contributor to the UN, China has always been resolutely safeguarding multilateralism, supporting the work of the UN and defending the principle and spirits of the UN Charter, Wang said.The US not only promotes unilateralism, but also interferes in other country's cooperation with the UN, which completely confuses right with wrong, and is entirely unreasonable, Wang noted.Craft accused, in her article, that Chinese nationals routinely violate UN requirements that individuals working for the institution act as international civil servants, rather than in the interests of their own countries.Wang commented on Craft's false remarks in the article, saying that international employees of the UN are all integral parts of the UN team, and their individual capability and professional ethics are widely acknowledged, and their contributions deserve respect from all. Craft's accusation against them is groundless, and insulting to all UN international employees, said Wang.There are 2,531 American employees in the UN system, with 19 of them holding posts as deputy secretary generals or assistant secretary generals, more than any other UN member state, said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, who asked, "Do Craft's accusations also apply to such American employees?"Craft and representatives from a few other nations deliberately tarnished China's image with human rights issues at the UN General Assembly Third Committee. China refuted them with well-founded facts and evidence, which won support from more than 70 countries. It fully demonstrates that more and more countries have seen clearly the true image of the US as a troublemaker. They are also fighting against US hegemony and political suppression with actions, Wang said, "So will Craft turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to the voice of the majority?"Wang continued to stress that US politicians such as Craft have openly provoked conflicts between powers in the UN and interfered in other countries' internal affairs, which does not accord with the will of the people."Craft used matters related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the island of Taiwan to interfere in China's internal affairs. It has violated international laws and basic norms of international relations, which Craft herself ironically takes pride in."Wang urged Craft to reflect on the range of American sovereignty and its own responsibility, and stop using lies as weapons. The foul acts will not address the US' own problems, nor will they make America great again.The world has entered the 21st century, and it will not go back to the road of the Cold War. Human beings are facing more and more global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the only solution is equal dialogue and consultation, strengthening international cooperation, and jointly safeguarding multilateralism and the international system with the United Nations as the core, he said.
