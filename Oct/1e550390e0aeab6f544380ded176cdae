Similar protests and marches against racism and police brutality have swept across the US during the last six months following the May 25 killing of African-American George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis.Waukegan is 25 kilometers south of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where sometimes violent protests erupted after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, a black man, in the back several times on August 23.According to Waukegan police, a Hispanic male officer was conducting a traffic stop on Tuesday night when he shot into the couple's car because it went into reverse and he feared for his safety. No firearm was found in the vehicle, the police said. Stinnette, who was the passenger in the vehicle, died, while Williams was wounded in the abdomen and wrist, according to Satrese Stallworth, a relative of Stinnette and a spokeswoman for the family.Williams remains in the hospital, the Waukegan Police Department said."We do not trust the police narrative in this case. We have seen over and over that the 'official' report when police kill black people is far too often missing or misrepresenting details," Williams' attorney, Ben Crump, said in a statement.The US Department of Justice has agreed to assist the Illinois State Police in its investigation.
