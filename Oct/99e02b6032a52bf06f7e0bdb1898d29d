People hold signs as they pay their respects to Ruth Bader Ginsburg near the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC on Saturday. US President Donald Trump vowed to quickly nominate a successor, likely a woman, to replace late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, only a day after the death of the liberal stalwart (See stories on Page 7, 15).
