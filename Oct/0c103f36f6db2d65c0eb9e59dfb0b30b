However, the economic toll on Kenya will require much effort and new strategies to ameliorate," he said.Kenyan sectors to be featured in the 2020 expo include tourism, agriculture, financial services and technology."To maximally gain from trade with China, both Nairobi and Beijing need to effect a number of things.
