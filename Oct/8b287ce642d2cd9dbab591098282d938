The order came after police on Monday launched a series of raids targeting Islamist networks.Paty, 47, was attacked on his way home from the junior high school where he taught in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.A photo of the teacher and a message confessing to his murder was found on the cellphone of his killer, 18-year-old Chechen Abdullakh Anzorov, who also posted images of the decapitated body on Twitter.Â Anzorov was shot dead by police.Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said Tuesday that Paty would be posthumously bestowed France's highest order of merit, the Legion of Honour, for having been "martyred" because of his profession.AFP
