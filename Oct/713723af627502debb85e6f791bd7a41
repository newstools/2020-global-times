The metal is vital to make alloys used in armor-piecing shells or bunker-buster bombs.For another three metals - niobium, titanium and cobalt - the US has no deposits while China has plenty. And they are indispensable in making airplanes, missiles and rocket engines, said Zhou, a former vice president of the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters.China put export restrictions on some of the metals to the US in 2010, causing a WTO lawsuit, which ruled against China in 2012. China then dropped its export quota system in 2015. However, China's new law on export controls, which will take effect on December 1, authorizes the government to take countermeasures against any country or region that abuses export control measures, and poses a threat to China's national security and interests."These metals are sold to foreign countries as general items," Zhou said. "The Ministry of Commerce could roll out documents to specify the nature of these metals for national defense use. That definition will give legal grounds for any ban or restriction of such metals."China's Ministry of Commerce said at a press conference on Thursday that it will actively promote the legislative work of supporting regulations in the export law, and will further improve and release an export control list in a timely manner in accordance with the legal provisions.
