A blind man running a radio station and hiring 15 people to work for the broadcasting service is proof of this fact," Shija told Xinhua.Shija, 30, lost his sight when he was seven years old due to a war injury. He said his radio station broadcast a variety of programs including music around the clock and aims to raise awareness about the rights of disabled people and their status in society.

"Four out of my 15 employees are disabled and they fulfill their responsibility perfectly," Shija, a father of three, whispered joyfully.Nasira Mubariz, a 17-year-old female who works as a news reader for the radio, said that she spent her salary from the station on her education.Disabled people in conflict-battered Afghanistan, according to Mubariz, comprise an "isolated segment" in society as people rarely respect their rights."Before joining Shija Radio I was a marginalized person in society and was often insulted by many people including strangers and relatives, but nowadays my family members and friends approach me politely," Mubariz explained.

We have the right to study, to work and to live our daily lives," Ahmad Baes, who was born blind 16 years ago in Jawzjan provincial capital Shiberghan City, told Xinhua.
