The maneuver will be done several times before it reaches Mars.

Two or three additional course corrections will be made before Tianwen-1 makes its rendezvous with the red planet.

During the previous maneuvers the engine ignition lasted just 10 seconds. During Friday’s operation the engine fired for more than eight minutes.Now it takes five to six minutes for commands from mission control on Earth to reach Tianwen-1.
