No study is completely risk-free, but the Human Challenge Program partners will be working hard to ensure we make the risks as low as we possibly can," said Chris Chiu, from the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London and lead researcher on the human challenge studies.The Human Challenge Program is a partnership between Imperial College London, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), hVIVO, a leading clinical company with expertise in viral human challenge models, and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. NHS stands for Britain's National Health Service.Explaining the purpose of the study, the college said that as the prevalence of COVID-19 rises and falls in populations, it can make it difficult for traditional vaccine trials to assess if vaccines work, because volunteers receiving the vaccine may not be naturally exposed to the virus.Human challenge studies help clinical researchers establish which vaccines are most likely to succeed and also make it possible for scientists to compare the efficacy of vaccine candidates by testing them side by side to establish which is more effective.Because a human challenge study deliberately infects the volunteers it should be possible for scientists to begin to establish efficacy very quickly, by testing if those who have had a vaccine are less likely to become infected with the virus, it also said."Deliberately infecting volunteers with a known human pathogen is never undertaken lightly. However, such studies are enormously informative about a disease, even one so well studied as COVID-19," said Professor Peter Openshaw, co-investigator on the study and director of the MRC-funded Human Challenge Consortium (HIC-Vac) at Imperial College London.
