Photo: VCGTurkey's two key Western allies, the US and Germany, on Tuesday urged it to pull back a ship it has returned to waters contested with Greece, with Washington denouncing the "calculated provocation."The Turkish navy said Sunday that the Oruc Reis exploration vessel was heading back to energy-rich eastern Mediterranean waters between the Greek island of Crete and Cyprus, weeks after it left amid an agreement for talks.In a strongly worded statement, the State Department said the US "deplores" the decision by Turkey and noted that Greece "asserts jurisdiction" over areas where the ship plans to operate through October 22."We urge Turkey to end this calculated provocation and immediately begin exploratory talks with Greece," State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said."Turkey's announcement unilaterally raises tensions in the region and deliberately complicates the resumption of crucial exploratory talks between our NATO allies Greece and Turkey," she said.Turkey last sent the ship into contested waters in August backed by warships, alarming both Greece and Cyprus, which is partially occupied by Ankara.Greece responded by staging military exercises but tensions eased when both Ankara and Athens agreed to talk.Greece said Tuesday there could be no diplomatic solution until the ship is withdrawn.Turkey hit back at the US statement, noting that Washington does not recognize the so-called Seville Map by Spanish scholars that is cited by Greece for its maritime claims.AFP
