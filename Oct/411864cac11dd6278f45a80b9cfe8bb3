It's very likely that he will continue the foreign policies of the former Abe administration, making only small adjustments and amendments.However, the US continuous crackdown on China is also exerting certain pressures on its allies including Japan. The blue paper also warned that China and Japan should turn the crisis into an opportunity and avoid conflicts in order to bring the bilateral relationship to the next level.
