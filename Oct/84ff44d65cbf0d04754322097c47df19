However, the history of friendly exchanges between the two peoples, which has lasted more than two thousand years, won't be hampered by the pandemic or temporary difficulties in bilateral relations.Sun said that as China-India relations confront challenges, it is all the more important for those who care about the relationship to play a positive role in strengthening public opinion on bilateral ties.
