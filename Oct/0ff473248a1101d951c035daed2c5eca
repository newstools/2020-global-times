We also found an imperial palace site for the emperor’s short stays away from the capital in the northwest of the imperial worship site,” Zhang Wenping, deputy head of the Regional Research Institute for Cultural Relics and Archaeology, told the Global Times on Thursday.Located in the north of Hohhot, capital city of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the site covered an area of about 10,000 square meters. The Chinese archaeology team has evacuated more than 1,300 square meters of the original site, and has determined its general shape and structure. “The next step for us is to figure out the situation and layout of some specific parts of the site,” Zhang said. Historical documents show that Emperor Xiaowen visited the place for a ceremony worshiping Heaven in 494 before he relocated the state capital. Chinese archaeologists estimate that the site is the place where the emperor worshiped, and the site was used roughly between 430 and 490.

The inner diameter of the house was about 15.5 meters and the outer diameter about 32.5 meters. A doorway of about one meter wide was discovered in the southeast of the house, while a small amount of pottery pots used for sacrifices were also unearthed.Zhang noted that the Northern Wei Dynasty imperial worship site had three worship platforms that are older than the Temple of Heaven in Beijing built during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911).Compared with the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, whose second platform for worship is a flat platform, the second layer on this site was a round house, which showcases the characteristics of the worship ritual system among the nomads in northern China.
