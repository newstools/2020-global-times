Some 12 million people in Britain are likely to struggle with bills and loan repayments as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak economic havoc, a Financial Conduct Authority survey tracking consumer financial resilience showed on Thursday.

And 36 percent of people feared falling behind on repayments linked to loans or credit cards."We want to remind consumers, especially those who are newly in financial difficulty that lenders are able to provide you with support," Sheldon Mills, the FCA's Interim Executive Director of Strategy and Competition said.The regulator has put together a package of measures to ensure vulnerable households can access help after October 31.
