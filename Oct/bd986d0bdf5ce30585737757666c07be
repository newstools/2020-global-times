She added that China will also strengthen vaccine cooperation with relevant countries through the COVAX network.As China continues to focus on ensuring that developing countries have equal access to appropriate, safe and effective vaccines, the country still decided to join COVAX even as it leads the world with several vaccines in advanced stages of R&D and with ample production capacity.Hua also said she hopes more capable countries will also join and support COVAX.COVAX is one of three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which was launched in April by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission and France in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.As of September 21, 156 countries have signed deals to join the COVID-19 vaccine allocation plan, the Guardian reported.
