The economy expanded by 6.1 percent in 2019.New types of businesses including smart manufacturing, industrial internet, e-commerce and the sharing economy are booming, driving high-quality development, Zhuang said.What's more, digital prowess is seen helping the nation's economy withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. China is widely expected to be the only major economy to post positive growth this year.Among the key factors underpinning China's virus containment are the nation's institutional and governance mechanisms, well-functioning e-commerce and distribution systems, and the innovative applications of AI technologies, according to Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlyTek, one of the nation's AI champions. AI-powered anti-epidemic efforts have addressed society's inelastic demand, Liu said at the three-day summit. The cumulative applications of the color-based QR health code program, designed to curb the spread of the disease, have totaled 63.94 million, and such codes have been shown 711 million times, Liu said.The digital push has lured businesses from both home and abroad to capitalize on the Chinese market.
