Colombian President Ivan Duque is confident his administration can cut the country's deforestation rate in half by the end of his four-year term, though it will be impossible to stop it completely, he told Reuters.

Some 38 million trees have been planted so far in 2020, and Duque said he was confident of meeting the final target.In 2018 and 2019 Colombia lost 356,053 hectares, while the millions of new trees are expected to cover some 300,000 hectares.Duque said he would keep fighting illegal logging and mining, drug trafficking and unauthorized clearing of land for cattle rearing, which all contribute to environmental destruction.In 2019 the government launched a campaign meant to tackle illegal activities, strengthening monitoring systems.
