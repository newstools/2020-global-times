The liquid natural gas (LNG) carrier Pan Americas carrying 67,000 tons of LNG from Hong Kong, berths at the LNG terminal in North China's Tianjin on Monday. The LNG terminal belongs to China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), one of the world's top gas importers. More than six million tons of clean energy has been delivered to North China via the terminal since it started operation in 2013.

Domestically, CNOOC expects its two major gas fields - newly developed Bozhong 19-6 condensate gas field and Lingshui 17-2 deepwater gas field in the South China Sea, which is expected to begin production in the second half of 2021 - will drive production of natural gas growth. Its third-quarter capital expenditure fell 5.8 percent to 18.4 billion yuan. Global Times
