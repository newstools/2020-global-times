(Xinhua/Xu Yu)Â China's northern regions will see temperatures fall and strong winds over the next few days, as a cold front is expected to sweep the areas on Friday evening, the national observatory forecast Thursday. Over the coming weekend, the cold front will cause temperatures to fall by 4 to 6 degrees Celsius in parts of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as well as areas in northern and northeastern China, with some regions expecting temperature plunges of up to 8 degrees Celsius during the period, according to the National Meteorological Center. Parts of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces will brace for rainy weather and slightly lower-than-average temperatures over the next 10 days, the center said. The center also forecast that Typhoon Chan-hom, the 14th of the year, will bring gales to parts of the East China Sea on Thursday and Friday.
