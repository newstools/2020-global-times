The vouchers are loaded with small lanterns and hung in the tree. Those who can find the lanterns in the morning can get a free breakfast in the school’s canteens.At the same time, association members will work together to make an agenda to call each other early every morning between 6:00 and 7:30am. Founded in 2018, the association was originally created to help students regain control over their lives. The association has been warmly welcomed by students. Since its establishment, its membership has grown from 50 to more than 700.Many students at XAUAT said the wake up association is very practical, especially now that the weather is getting cold and people have begun struggling to get out of bed. Some look forward to being greeted by the association’s morning call.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
