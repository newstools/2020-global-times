The WWF has also launched a plan to protect the two species this year.China has rich experience in protecting and taking care of giant pandas, and the experience can be used to care for snow leopards. Li Sheng, a researcher at the School of Life Science at Peking University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that giving joint consideration to these two species is a new strategy.

So giving consideration to these two animals can broaden the protection scope and benefit more species with different ecological needs in the same area,” Li said.China is building a national park for giant pandas, which can accommodate numerous animals including large carnivores under a larger protective system. The national park will cover an area of about 27,000 kilometers, crossing three provinces – Sichuan Province and Northwest China’s Shaanxi and Gansu provinces – as well as 12 cities, providing unprecedented new opportunities to protect large carnivores within the pandas’ habitat.Li noted that the protection plan for pandas and snow leopards will play an important role in the national park and it can benefit the whole ecological system.
