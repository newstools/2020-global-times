Now we're back up to about 50,000 new cases a day. And it's going to continue to rise," said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine."This is the fall/winter surge that everyone was worried about. And now it's happening," Hotez said, adding the surge is happening especially in the northern Midwest, and is going to be nationally soon enough.Much of the United States continues to report an upward trend in COVID-19 cases, with 63,486 new confirmed cases and 892 new deaths reported nationwide on Thursday alone, according to data updated Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The new daily case count has set a new record high since July 31.Daily confirmed cases have been surpassing 45,000 since Oct. 7, CDC data showed, with cases over 50,000 five times since last week.Thirty-five states are showing increases in new COVID-19 cases greater than 10 percent over the last week compared to the week prior, according to a CNN report.Since Sunday, 21 states have hit their peak seven-day average of new cases since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
