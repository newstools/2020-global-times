More than 120 people have died."The lack of funding is posing a serious challenge, especially for the health sector, as well as in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, for which aid is critical to respond to both the floods and the current pandemic," Dujarric told a regular briefing.More than 400 schools and thousands of health facilities have been damaged, compromising education and health services, he said. Nearly 30,000 latrines have collapsed, which could hinder the prevention and treatment of potential disease outbreaks.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Thursday in its updated situation report that 46 percent of the 1.6 billion U.S. dollars required for Sudan has been funded.
