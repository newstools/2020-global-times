People can get to know more about the work, the accommodation conditions and salaries offered by the companies before making their choices, Rehmanjan Dawut, general director of the Xinjiang Regional Department of Human Resources and Social Security, said on Friday.Residents can make their own choice about employment, Rehmanjan said.
