Since monitoring began in 1998, it is second only to the record in 2005. There were 5,993 fires in a single month.

It accuses those companies of harmful practices including land seizures, violence against indigenous groups, illegal deforestation and the use of harmful pesticides.Â Such conflicts around land are fueling a surge in violence against indigenous peoples in the Amazon.Many of the companies denied the accusations.
