"Rushing these sales is not in anyone's interest."The Democratic congressman noted that the potential F-35 sale to the UAE would change the military balance in the Gulf and affect Israel's military edge. He also expressed concerns about the possible leaks of F-35's sensitive technology, and the sale might generate demands from other Arab states for advanced weapons in exchange for normalization with Israel."In the coming days, I invite members of Congress who share my concerns to join me in introducing legislation to ensure that the sale of these types of weapons adhere to our most important national security goals," Engel said.The proposed sale needs to be approved by Congress.According to media reports, the deal would include up to 50 of the Lockheed Martin-made F-35 jets at the cost of 10.4 billion US dollars. If the sale is completed, the UAE will become only the second country in the region to fly these stealth fighter jets after Israel.Reports said that the F-35 deal was a part of the US-brokered agreement to normalize ties between the UAE and Israel, which was signed last month.
