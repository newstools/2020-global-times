Defense Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, who coordinated the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions, announced that the measures will be in force in Kuala Lumpur, the administration center of Putrajaya as well as the adjacent Selangor state from Oct. 14 to 27, in response to the spike in daily new COVID-19 cases, with the measures aimed at breaking the chain of infections. During the period, inter-district travel is not allowed apart from work purpose. Schools, daycare centers, public parks, recreational centers and places of worship will be closed, while sports and social activities will not be allowed. However, economic activities in the affected areas will not be halted, with standard operating procedures (SOP) and guidelines implemented for the safety of workers. More restrictive measures will be in place in the country's eastern Sabah state from Oct. 13-26, he said.
