The majestic ruins at the top of the mountain have hundreds of rooms. The most impressive scene is the monastery atop the whole complex and well-designed stupas below.Folk legend says that the ruin was originally the residence of a general under King Gesar. In the ruin, there is a castle that is said to be the general’s castle. Later, the local government moved into the complex.The protection work cleaned up the major parts of the ruin, including several palaces and the temple of the dragon king.Four walls of a hall for worshipping Buddha have wall paintings, but most of them have been damaged.When cleaning up the buildings, hundreds of relics of various types were unearthed, mainly the remains of scriptures and murals, stone carvings and pottery pieces. To figure out the history of the ruin and what the buildings were like in previous times, the protection team from the institute visited and consulted local senior residents.The first step of the work started in July this year and ended on October 4. The team used advanced technology such as taking aerial photos with drones to improve the quality and efficiency of the protection work.Global Times Massive changes to California voting spark fears of Iowa-style primary chaosAsian Americans wait for their turn to shine in HollywoodCal's epidemic protection services still have room for improvement
