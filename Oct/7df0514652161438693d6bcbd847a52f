These winners got a massive earnings boost from the nation's anti-epidemic efforts and the thriving stay-at-home economy during the first six months.Shenzhen-listed hog breeder Ningbo Tech-bank is currently top-ranked with its net profits expected to surge from 11.94 million ($1.78 million) to 2.9 billion yuan year-on-year, the company revealed in a filing on Friday.

Other than the STAR 50 Index tracking the tech-heavy STAR Market, all three other major indices posted a gain in the third quarter."Expectations for a better performance have already been reflected in the previous stock rallies, in line with market estimates," Wu Jinduo, head of fixed income at the research institute of Great Wall Securities, told the Global Times on Saturday. The Chinese economy is on course to continue its rebound in the third quarter after swinging back to positive growth in the second quarter, Wu said.The economy contracted 6.8 percent in the first quarter, its first contraction in decades, official data showed.Firms hoping for better-than-expected earnings are mostly in the fields of medicine, food and beverage, and farm machines, which have either benefited from demands for anti-epidemic supplies and the development of vaccines or have shown to have been barely impacted by the pandemic, said Wu, adding that cement and glass, which are among the sectors benefiting from increased investment in infrastructure and real estate, are also expected to post stable performance.Listed firms in the services sector that were battered by the pandemic are expected to post poor earnings, but their plight is likely to be consciously eased in the last quarter, the analyst reckoned, noting that the performance of listed firms and their corporate governance lay the micro groundwork for the economy's quality growth.In a fresh push to build a healthy capital market, the State Council, the country's cabinet, on Friday unveiled a document urging improved quality of listed firms. Global Times
