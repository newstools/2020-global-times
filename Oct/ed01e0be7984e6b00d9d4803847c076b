It is easy to intercept, and not much more advanced than Taiwan's own Hsiung Feng II and Hsiung Feng III missiles, mainland experts said.Three other types of weapons, namely a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) truck-based rocket launcher, SLAM-ER long-range air-to-ground missiles, and external sensor pods for F-16 jets that allow the real-time transmission of imagery and data from the aircraft to ground stations, was submitted to the US Congress previously, Reuters reported on Monday.HIMARS can launch rockets and missiles that reach a range of between 70 and 499 kilometers, with the ability to conduct maritime operations, according to Lockheed Martin.HIMARS is a very aggressive weapon with high mobility. So if a war breaks out, the PLA should note its presence, locate its position via reconnaissance, and destroy it as soon as possible, analysts said.SLAM-ER is considered a variant for the air-launched Harpoon, with a maximum range of 250 kilometers. Mainland experts noted that this attack weapon will give the island the capability to attack from outside hostile defense zones. However, it is questionable how Taiwan can use it, because Taiwan's F-16 fighter jets would require modification to use this missile, and the P-3C maritime patrol aircraft, which can carry the missile, would be too slow and incapable of penetrating any defense.The sensor pods for F-16s could enhance Taiwan's reconnaissance capability and guide attacks for the previously mentioned missiles and rockets, analysts said, noting that during wartime, Taiwan's limited F-16s would be shot down, or cannot take off due to PLA strikes on airfields.On a tactical level, the PLA will pay close attention to these weapons and minimize their effect on the battlefield. On a strategic level, they will not change the balance of military strength between the PLA and the island's military, mainland experts said.
