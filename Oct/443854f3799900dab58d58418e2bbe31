The United States will fully develop ground-launched conventional missiles after withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Friday.

We can strike it tomorrow, in fact. But Moscow is going to have to show the political will to do so as well," Billingslea said in a statement.At issue are US demands that Russia halt nuclear activities during the extension period and submit to verification.Billingslea said that the US would also accept reciprocal inspections.AFP
